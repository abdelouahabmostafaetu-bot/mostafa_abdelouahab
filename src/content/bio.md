# About Me

I am a Master's student in **Fundamental Mathematics** at the **University of Mila**, Algeria. My academic journey has been driven by a deep fascination with the elegance and rigor of pure mathematics, particularly in the areas of dynamical systems, advanced analysis, and topology.

## My Journey

My love for mathematics began during my early education, where I was captivated by the logical structure and beauty of mathematical proofs. This passion led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at the University of Mila, where I discovered my interest in dynamical systems and their connections to analysis and topology.

During my undergraduate years, I developed a strong foundation in real and complex analysis, abstract algebra, and differential equations. I was particularly drawn to the interplay between topological concepts and dynamical behavior, which eventually became the focus of my graduate research.

## Research

My current research, conducted under the supervision of **[Advisor Name]**, focuses on the **stability properties of discrete dynamical systems** defined on abstract metric spaces. I am developing new criteria for asymptotic stability using tools from fixed-point theory and Lyapunov analysis.

I am also interested in:
- **Topological dynamics** and the classification of dynamical systems up to topological conjugacy
- **Integral inequalities** and their applications to the theory of differential equations
- **Ergodic theory** and its connections to number theory and probability

## Teaching & Outreach

I believe strongly in mathematical communication and enjoy sharing my knowledge through tutoring and writing. I regularly help fellow students with coursework in analysis and topology, and I maintain this website as a platform to share mathematical ideas and resources with a wider audience.

## Beyond Mathematics

When I'm not studying mathematics, I enjoy reading about the history and philosophy of science, exploring computational tools like Python and Mathematica for mathematical experimentation, and staying connected with the broader mathematical community through conferences and seminars.
