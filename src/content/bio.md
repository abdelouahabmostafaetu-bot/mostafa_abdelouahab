# About Me

I am a Master student in **Fundamental Mathematics** at the **University of Mila**, Algeria. My academic journey has been driven by a deep fascination with the elegance and rigor of pure mathematics, particularly in the areas of closed-form definite integrals, special functions, and advanced analysis.

## My Journey

My love for mathematics began during my early education, where I was captivated by the logical structure of the subject and the elegance of rigorous proofs. This passion led me to pursue a Bachelor degree in Mathematics at the University of Mila, where I developed a particular fascination with closed-form expressions, infinite series, and definite integrals—especially classical and famous problems in analysis.

During my undergraduate studies, I built a solid foundation in real and complex analysis, abstract algebra, and differential equations. I became increasingly interested in the search for closed forms of series and integrals, as well as the techniques used to evaluate challenging definite integrals, a theme that naturally evolved into the central focus of my graduate work and independent study.

## Research

My current research, conducted under the supervision of **[Advisor Name]**, focuses on the evaluation of definite integrals and infinite series, with an emphasis on obtaining closed-form expressions for problems arising in classical analysis. I am particularly interested in integrals and series that involve special functions, intricate transformations, or subtle convergence phenomena, especially those that appear in famous or historically significant problems.

I am also interested in:
- **Closed-form evaluations of definite integrals**, especially those connected to special functions and classical constants
- **Infinite series**, including convergence acceleration techniques and identification of closed forms
- **Integral inequalities** and their applications to analysis and approximation theory

## Teaching & Outreach

I believe strongly in mathematical communication and enjoy sharing my knowledge through tutoring and writing. I regularly help fellow students with coursework in analysis and related areas, and I maintain this website as a platform to share mathematical ideas, problems, and resources with a wider audience.

## Beyond Mathematics

When I'm not studying mathematics, I enjoy reading about the history and philosophy of science, exploring computational tools like Python and MATLAB for mathematical experimentation, and staying connected with the broader mathematical community through conferences and seminars.
