    "abstract": "We study the stability properties of discrete dynamical systems defined on complete metric spaces. Using fixed-point theorems and Lyapunov-type functions, we establish new sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of equilibrium points. Our results generalize classical theorems by relaxing the smoothness requirements on the underlying maps.",
