## Introduction

**Complex analysis** is often called the most beautiful branch of mathematics. At its heart lies **Cauchy's theorem**, which states that the integral of a holomorphic function around a closed curve is zero. This seemingly simple statement has extraordinary consequences that give complex analysis its magical character.

## Holomorphic Functions

A function $f: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ is **holomorphic** (complex differentiable) at $z_0$ if the limit:

$$
f'(z_0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0)}{h}
$$

exists, where $h \in \mathbb{C}$. This is vastly more restrictive than real differentiability because $h$ can approach $0$ from any direction in the plane.

Writing $f = u + iv$ and $z = x + iy$, holomorphicity is equivalent to the **Cauchy–Riemann equations**:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
$$

## Cauchy's Integral Theorem

**Theorem (Cauchy).** If $f$ is holomorphic on a simply connected domain $D$ and $\gamma$ is a closed curve in $D$, then:

$$
\oint_\gamma f(z) \, dz = 0
$$

This is the fundamental theorem of complex analysis. The proof uses Green's theorem and the Cauchy–Riemann equations:

$$
\oint_\gamma f(z) \, dz = \iint_D \left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right) + i\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\right) \, dx \, dy = 0
$$

## Cauchy's Integral Formula

**Theorem.** If $f$ is holomorphic inside and on a simple closed curve $\gamma$, then for any $z_0$ inside $\gamma$:

$$
f(z_0) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} \, dz
$$

This is remarkable: **the values of $f$ on the boundary completely determine $f$ in the interior**.

### Consequences

**1. Derivatives.** Holomorphic functions are infinitely differentiable:

$$
f^{(n)}(z_0) = \frac{n!}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{(z - z_0)^{n+1}} \, dz
$$

**2. Liouville's Theorem.** A bounded entire function is constant.

**3. Maximum Modulus Principle.** If $f$ is holomorphic and non-constant on a domain $D$, then $|f|$ has no maximum in $D$.

## Laurent Series and Residues

Near an isolated singularity $z_0$, $f$ has a **Laurent expansion**:

$$
f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} a_n (z - z_0)^n
$$

The coefficient $a_{-1}$ is called the **residue** of $f$ at $z_0$:

$$
\text{Res}(f, z_0) = a_{-1} = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma f(z) \, dz
$$

### The Residue Theorem

**Theorem.** If $f$ is holomorphic except at isolated singularities $z_1, \ldots, z_k$ inside $\gamma$, then:

$$
\oint_\gamma f(z) \, dz = 2\pi i \sum_{j=1}^{k} \text{Res}(f, z_j)
$$

## Application: A Real Integral via Residues

Evaluate $\displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{dx}{1 + x^2}$.

Consider $f(z) = \frac{1}{1+z^2} = \frac{1}{(z+i)(z-i)}$.

The only singularity in the upper half-plane is $z = i$ with:

$$
\text{Res}(f, i) = \lim_{z \to i} (z - i) \cdot \frac{1}{(z+i)(z-i)} = \frac{1}{2i}
$$

By the residue theorem (closing the contour in the upper half-plane):

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{dx}{1 + x^2} = 2\pi i \cdot \frac{1}{2i} = \pi
$$

This recovers of course $\arctan(x)\big|_{-\infty}^\infty = \pi$.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Cauchy's theorem** is the foundation: integrals of holomorphic functions around closed curves vanish.
2. **Cauchy's integral formula** shows that holomorphic functions are determined by their boundary values.
3. The **residue theorem** converts complex integrals into algebraic computations.
4. Complex analysis is **rigid**: holomorphicity is an incredibly strong condition that constrains functions far more than real differentiability.
