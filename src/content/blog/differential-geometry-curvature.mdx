## Introduction

**Differential geometry** is the study of curves, surfaces, and higher-dimensional manifolds using the tools of calculus. At its heart lies the concept of **curvature** — the quantitative measure of how a geometric object bends and twists. From Gauss's stunning discovery that curvature is intrinsic, to the Gauss–Bonnet theorem linking geometry to topology, differential geometry is one of the most beautiful and consequential areas of mathematics.

## Curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$

A smooth curve $\gamma: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^3$ parametrized by arc length has:

**Curvature:** $\kappa = |\gamma''(s)|$, measuring how fast the curve turns.

**Torsion:** $\tau = -\mathbf{b}'(s) \cdot \mathbf{n}(s)$, measuring how the curve twists out of its osculating plane.

The **Frenet–Serret formulas** relate the tangent $\mathbf{t}$, normal $\mathbf{n}$, and binormal $\mathbf{b}$:

$$
\begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{t}' \\ \mathbf{n}' \\ \mathbf{b}' \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \kappa & 0 \\ -\kappa & 0 & \tau \\ 0 & -\tau & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{t} \\ \mathbf{n} \\ \mathbf{b} \end{pmatrix}
$$

**Theorem.** A curve in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is determined up to rigid motion by its curvature $\kappa(s)$ and torsion $\tau(s)$.

## Surfaces

A **regular surface** $S \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is locally parametrized by $\mathbf{r}(u,v): U \to \mathbb{R}^3$ where $\mathbf{r}_u \times \mathbf{r}_v \neq 0$.

### The First Fundamental Form

The **first fundamental form** $I$ is the metric on $S$ inherited from $\mathbb{R}^3$:

$$
I = E\,du^2 + 2F\,du\,dv + G\,dv^2
$$

where $E = \mathbf{r}_u \cdot \mathbf{r}_u$, $F = \mathbf{r}_u \cdot \mathbf{r}_v$, $G = \mathbf{r}_v \cdot \mathbf{r}_v$.

This encodes all **intrinsic geometry**: lengths, angles, and areas on the surface.

### The Second Fundamental Form

The **second fundamental form** $II$ measures the extrinsic curvature — how $S$ bends in $\mathbb{R}^3$:

$$
II = e\,du^2 + 2f\,du\,dv + g\,dv^2
$$

where $e = \mathbf{r}_{uu} \cdot \mathbf{n}$, $f = \mathbf{r}_{uv} \cdot \mathbf{n}$, $g = \mathbf{r}_{vv} \cdot \mathbf{n}$, and $\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal.

## Gaussian and Mean Curvature

At each point $p \in S$, the **principal curvatures** $\kappa_1, \kappa_2$ are the maximum and minimum normal curvatures.

**Gaussian curvature:**

$$
K = \kappa_1 \kappa_2 = \frac{eg - f^2}{EG - F^2}
$$

**Mean curvature:**

$$
H = \frac{\kappa_1 + \kappa_2}{2} = \frac{eG - 2fF + gE}{2(EG - F^2)}
$$

**Geometric meaning:**
- $K > 0$: **elliptic** point (sphere-like, all curves bend the same way)
- $K < 0$: **hyperbolic** point (saddle-like, curves bend in opposite directions)
- $K = 0$: **parabolic** point (cylinder-like, flat in one direction)
- $H = 0$: **minimal surface** (soap film — each point is a saddle point)

## Gauss's Theorema Egregium

**Theorem (Gauss, 1827).** The Gaussian curvature $K$ depends only on the first fundamental form (the metric) — it is an **intrinsic** invariant.

This is Gauss's "remarkable theorem": even though $K$ is defined using how the surface bends in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (extrinsic), it can be computed purely from measurements made **on** the surface (intrinsic). A being living on the surface could determine $K$ without knowing about the ambient space.

**Consequence:** You cannot flatten a sphere without distortion ($K = 1/r^2 \neq 0$), which is why all world maps have distortions. But you can unroll a cylinder ($K = 0$).

**Gauss's formula:**

$$
K = \frac{1}{\sqrt{EG}} \left[-\frac{\partial}{\partial u}\frac{E_v}{2\sqrt{EG}} - \frac{\partial}{\partial v}\frac{G_u}{2\sqrt{EG}}\right]
$$

(in orthogonal coordinates where $F = 0$).

## Geodesics

A **geodesic** is a curve on $S$ that is "as straight as possible" — its acceleration has no tangential component. Geodesics satisfy:

$$
\ddot{u}^k + \Gamma^k_{ij}\dot{u}^i\dot{u}^j = 0
$$

where $\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are the **Christoffel symbols**, computed from the metric.

**Examples:**
- On the sphere $S^2$: geodesics are great circles.
- On the plane: geodesics are straight lines.
- On a cylinder: geodesics are helices (including straight lines and circles as special cases).

## The Gauss–Bonnet Theorem

**Theorem (Gauss–Bonnet, local form).** For a geodesic triangle $\Delta$ on a surface:

$$
\int\int_\Delta K \, dA = (\alpha + \beta + \gamma) - \pi
$$

where $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are the interior angles. The angle excess equals the total curvature!

**Theorem (Gauss–Bonnet, global form).** For a compact oriented surface $S$ without boundary:

$$
\int\int_S K \, dA = 2\pi \chi(S)
$$

where $\chi(S)$ is the **Euler characteristic**.

**Consequences:**
- **Sphere:** $K = 1/r^2$, $\int K\,dA = 4\pi = 2\pi \cdot 2 = 2\pi\chi(S^2)$ ✓
- **Torus:** $\chi = 0$, so $\int K\,dA = 0$ — the positive and negative curvature exactly cancel.
- **The total curvature is a topological invariant** — it doesn't change under continuous deformations!

This is one of the most beautiful theorems in all of mathematics: **geometry determines topology**.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Curvature** quantifies bending — $K$ is intrinsic (Theorema Egregium), $H$ is extrinsic.
2. **Geodesics** are the "straight lines" on surfaces, governed by the metric.
3. The **Gauss–Bonnet theorem** links total curvature to topology via the Euler characteristic.
4. Differential geometry is the foundation of **general relativity** and modern geometric analysis.
