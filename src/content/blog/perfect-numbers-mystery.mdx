## Introduction

A positive integer $n$ is **perfect** if it equals the sum of its proper divisors:

$$
\sigma(n) = 2n
$$

The first few: $6 = 1+2+3$, $28 = 1+2+4+7+14$, $496$, $8128$.

## Euclid-Euler Theorem

**Theorem.** An **even** number is perfect if and only if it has the form:

$$
n = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1)
$$

where $2^p - 1$ is a **Mersenne prime**.

Known Mersenne primes: $p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, \ldots$ As of 2024, 51 Mersenne primes are known, giving 51 even perfect numbers.

## The Odd Perfect Number Question

**Open problem:** Do **odd** perfect numbers exist?

If one exists, it must satisfy:
- $n > 10^{1500}$
- $n$ has at least 101 prime factors (counted with multiplicity)
- The largest prime factor exceeds $10^8$

Most number theorists believe none exist, but no proof exists.

## Abundancy and Deficiency

Define the **abundancy index** $I(n) = \sigma(n)/n$:
- $I(n) = 2$: perfect
- $I(n) > 2$: abundant ($n = 12$: $\sigma(12)/12 = 28/12 > 2$)
- $I(n) < 2$: deficient ($n = 8$: $\sigma(8)/8 = 15/8 < 2$)

## Key Takeaways

1. Even perfect numbers are completely characterized by Mersenne primes.
2. The existence of odd perfect numbers is one of the oldest open problems (2,000+ years).
3. The density of perfect numbers among integers is zero.
