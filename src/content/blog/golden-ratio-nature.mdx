## Introduction

The **golden ratio** $\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.6180339887\ldots$ is perhaps the most famous irrational number after $\pi$ and $e$. It appears in geometry, algebra, number theory, art, and biology with a frequency that borders on the mystical.

## Algebraic Definition

The golden ratio is the positive root of:

$$
x^2 - x - 1 = 0
$$

This gives $\varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Its conjugate is $\hat{\varphi} = \frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx -0.618$.

The defining property is **self-similarity**: $\varphi = 1 + \frac{1}{\varphi}$, or equivalently $\varphi^2 = \varphi + 1$.

## Connection to Fibonacci Numbers

The Fibonacci sequence $F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n$ is intimately connected to $\varphi$ through **Binet's formula**:

$$
F_n = \frac{\varphi^n - \hat{\varphi}^n}{\sqrt{5}}
$$

Since $|\hat{\varphi}| < 1$, we get $F_n \approx \frac{\varphi^n}{\sqrt{5}}$ for large $n$. The ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers converges:

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n} = \varphi
$$

## The Golden Rectangle and Spiral

A **golden rectangle** has sides in ratio $\varphi : 1$. Removing a square from it yields another golden rectangle — this self-similar property generates the **golden spiral**, a logarithmic spiral with growth factor $\varphi$.

The spiral's equation in polar coordinates:

$$
r = a \cdot \varphi^{2\theta/\pi}
$$

## Continued Fraction Representation

The golden ratio has the simplest possible continued fraction:

$$
\varphi = 1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cdots}}}
$$

This makes $\varphi$ the **most irrational number** — it is the hardest real number to approximate by rationals, in the sense of the Hurwitz constant.

## Key Takeaways

1. $\varphi$ satisfies $\varphi^2 = \varphi + 1$, the simplest quadratic with self-similar structure.
2. Binet's formula connects $\varphi$ directly to Fibonacci numbers.
3. The golden ratio's continued fraction $[1; 1, 1, 1, \ldots]$ makes it the "most irrational" number.
4. Golden rectangles and spirals arise from the self-similar subdivision property.
