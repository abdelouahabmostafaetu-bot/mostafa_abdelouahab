## Introduction

**Ramsey theory** is the study of the inevitable emergence of order in sufficiently large structures. Its motto: *complete disorder is impossible*.

## The Party Problem

**Theorem (Ramsey).** Among any 6 people at a party, there exist either 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual strangers.

*Proof.* Model as a 2-coloring of $K_6$ (complete graph on 6 vertices). Pick vertex $v$. By pigeonhole, $v$ has $\geq 3$ edges of the same color, say red, to vertices $a, b, c$. If any edge among $\{a,b,c\}$ is red, we have a red triangle. Otherwise, $a, b, c$ form a blue triangle. $\square$

## Ramsey Numbers

$R(s, t) =$ the minimum $n$ such that any 2-coloring of $K_n$ contains a red $K_s$ or a blue $K_t$.

Known values: $R(3,3) = 6$, $R(3,4) = 9$, $R(3,5) = 14$, $R(4,4) = 18$.

**Erdős-Szekeres bound:**

$$
R(s,t) \leq \binom{s+t-2}{s-1}
$$

The exact value of $R(5,5)$ remains unknown! Best current bounds: $43 \leq R(5,5) \leq 48$.

## Infinite Ramsey Theorem

**Theorem.** For any coloring of the edges of the complete graph on $\mathbb{N}$ with finitely many colors, there exists an infinite monochromatic complete subgraph.

## Key Takeaways

1. Ramsey theory guarantees structure in sufficiently large systems.
2. Computing Ramsey numbers is extraordinarily difficult — most are unknown.
3. The theory extends to graphs, arithmetic progressions (van der Waerden), and geometry.
