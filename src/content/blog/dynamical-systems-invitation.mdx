## Introduction

**Dynamical systems** is the mathematical study of how things evolve over time. Whether we model population growth, planetary motion, or weather patterns, the language of dynamical systems provides the tools to analyze, predict, and understand the long-term behavior of deterministic processes. As my primary research area, I want to share the beauty and depth of this subject.

## Discrete Dynamical Systems

A **discrete dynamical system** is defined by iteration of a map $f: X \to X$. Starting from an initial condition $x_0$, the **orbit** is:

$$
x_0, \, f(x_0), \, f^2(x_0), \, f^3(x_0), \, \ldots
$$

where $f^n = f \circ f \circ \cdots \circ f$ ($n$ times).

### Fixed Points and Periodic Orbits

A point $x^*$ is a **fixed point** if $f(x^*) = x^*$. It is **periodic** with period $n$ if $f^n(x^*) = x^*$ and $f^k(x^*) \neq x^*$ for $0 < k < n$.

**Stability:** A fixed point $x^*$ of a smooth map $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is:
- **Stable (attracting)** if $|f'(x^*)| < 1$
- **Unstable (repelling)** if $|f'(x^*)| > 1$
- **Neutral** if $|f'(x^*)| = 1$

## The Logistic Map

The **logistic map** $f_r(x) = rx(1-x)$ for $r \in [0, 4]$ is the paradigmatic example of how simple rules can produce complex behavior.

For different values of $r$:

| Parameter $r$ | Behavior |
|---|---|
| $0 < r < 1$ | All orbits converge to $0$ |
| $1 < r < 3$ | Orbits converge to a nonzero fixed point |
| $3 < r < 3.449$ | Period-2 cycle |
| $3.449 < r < 3.544$ | Period-4 cycle |
| $r \approx 3.5699$ | Onset of chaos (Feigenbaum point) |
| $r = 4$ | Full chaos on $[0,1]$ |

## Bifurcation Theory

A **bifurcation** occurs when a small change in a parameter causes a qualitative change in the system's behavior.

### Saddle-Node Bifurcation

The map $f_\mu(x) = x + \mu - x^2$ has:
- Two fixed points for $\mu > 0$
- One fixed point at $\mu = 0$
- No fixed points for $\mu < 0$

### Period-Doubling Bifurcation

As $r$ increases in the logistic map, stable fixed points become unstable while stable period-2 orbits appear. This cascade follows **Feigenbaum's universal constants**:

$$
\delta = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{r_n - r_{n-1}}{r_{n+1} - r_n} \approx 4.6692\ldots
$$

Remarkably, this constant is **universal** — it appears in every one-parameter family of maps undergoing period-doubling.

## Continuous Dynamical Systems

A **continuous dynamical system** (flow) is defined by an ODE:

$$
\dot{x} = f(x), \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^n
$$

The solution $\varphi_t(x_0)$ gives the state at time $t$ starting from $x_0$.

### The Hartman–Grobman Theorem

Near a **hyperbolic** fixed point (all eigenvalues of $Df(x^*)$ have nonzero real part), the nonlinear flow is **topologically conjugate** to its linearization:

$$
\dot{x} = Df(x^*) \cdot x
$$

This justifies using linear stability analysis for qualitative behavior near equilibria.

## Chaos

A dynamical system exhibits **chaos** (in the sense of Devaney) if it satisfies:

1. **Sensitivity to initial conditions:** Small differences in initial conditions grow exponentially.
2. **Topological transitivity:** The system cannot be decomposed into invariant subsystems.
3. **Dense periodic orbits:** Periodic points are dense in the space.

### Lyapunov Exponents

The **Lyapunov exponent** quantifies sensitivity:

$$
\lambda = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \ln|f'(x_k)|
$$

- $\lambda > 0$: chaos (exponential divergence of nearby orbits)
- $\lambda < 0$: stable periodic behavior
- $\lambda = 0$: neutral/bifurcation point

## Key Takeaways

1. Even simple deterministic maps can exhibit **chaotic** behavior — complexity emerges from simplicity.
2. **Bifurcation theory** explains how systems transition between qualitatively different behaviors.
3. The **Feigenbaum constant** reveals a deep universality in the route to chaos.
4. Understanding stability through eigenvalues and Lyapunov exponents is the first step in analyzing any dynamical system.
