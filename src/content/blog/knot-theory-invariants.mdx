## Introduction

**Knot theory** is the study of smooth closed curves embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (or $S^3$), considered up to ambient isotopy — continuous deformations that don't cut or pass the curve through itself. The fundamental question is deceptively simple: **when are two knots the same?** The answer requires deep invariants drawn from algebra, topology, and even quantum physics.

## Basic Definitions

A **knot** $K$ is a smooth embedding $S^1 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$, considered up to ambient isotopy. A **link** is a disjoint union of knots.

Knots are typically studied via their **diagrams**: projections onto the plane with crossing information (over/under) recorded.

### The Simplest Knots

| Knot | Crossings | Name |
|------|-----------|------|
| $0_1$ | 0 | Unknot |
| $3_1$ | 3 | Trefoil |
| $4_1$ | 4 | Figure-eight |
| $5_1$ | 5 | Solomon's seal |
| $5_2$ | 5 | Three-twist |

**The fundamental problem:** Is a given knot diagram the unknot? This is algorithmically decidable (Haken, 1961) but computationally hard.

## Reidemeister Moves

**Theorem (Reidemeister, 1927).** Two knot diagrams represent the same knot if and only if they are related by a finite sequence of three local moves:

- **R1:** Add/remove a twist (loop)
- **R2:** Add/remove two crossings between strands
- **R3:** Slide a strand over/under a crossing

Any **knot invariant** must be unchanged by all three Reidemeister moves.

## Classical Invariants

### Tricolorability

A knot is **tricolorable** if its arcs can be colored with three colors such that:
1. At least two colors are used
2. At each crossing, either all three colors appear or only one color appears

**The trefoil is tricolorable; the unknot is not.** Therefore, the trefoil is a nontrivial knot.

### The Knot Group

The **knot group** $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}^3 \setminus K)$ is the fundamental group of the complement. It is a powerful invariant.

**Wirtinger presentation:** From a diagram, one reads off generators (one per arc) and relations (one per crossing):

$$
\pi_1(\mathbb{R}^3 \setminus \text{trefoil}) = \langle a, b \mid aba = bab \rangle
$$

This is the **braid group** $B_3$ — nontrivial, confirming the trefoil is knotted.

### The Alexander Polynomial

The **Alexander polynomial** $\Delta_K(t) \in \mathbb{Z}[t, t^{-1}]$ is defined from the knot group (or via the Seifert matrix).

**Examples:**
- Unknot: $\Delta(t) = 1$
- Trefoil: $\Delta(t) = t - 1 + t^{-1}$
- Figure-eight: $\Delta(t) = -t + 3 - t^{-1}$

Properties: $\Delta_K(1) = 1$ and $\Delta_K(t) = \Delta_K(t^{-1})$ (symmetry).

**Limitation:** The Alexander polynomial cannot distinguish the trefoil from its mirror image, and some nontrivial knots have $\Delta = 1$.

## The Jones Polynomial

**Theorem (Jones, 1984).** There exists a knot invariant $V_K(t) \in \mathbb{Z}[t^{1/2}, t^{-1/2}]$ uniquely defined by:

1. $V_{\text{unknot}}(t) = 1$
2. The **skein relation:**

$$
t^{-1} V_{L_+} - t\,V_{L_-} + (t^{1/2} - t^{-1/2})\,V_{L_0} = 0
$$

where $L_+, L_-, L_0$ are three links differing at a single crossing.

**Examples:**
- Trefoil: $V(t) = -t^{-4} + t^{-3} + t^{-1}$
- Figure-eight: $V(t) = t^2 - t + 1 - t^{-1} + t^{-2}$

The Jones polynomial **can** distinguish mirror images (it detects chirality) and is strictly stronger than the Alexander polynomial.

### Connection to Physics

Witten (1989) showed that the Jones polynomial arises from a **topological quantum field theory** (TQFT): Chern–Simons gauge theory with gauge group $SU(2)$. The Jones polynomial of a knot $K$ is:

$$
V_K(t) = \langle W_R(K) \rangle_{CS}
$$

the vacuum expectation value of a Wilson loop. This earned Witten the Fields Medal and opened deep connections between knot theory and quantum physics.

## The HOMFLY-PT Polynomial

The **HOMFLY-PT polynomial** $P_K(a, z)$ generalizes both the Alexander and Jones polynomials:

$$
a\,P_{L_+} - a^{-1}\,P_{L_-} = z\,P_{L_0}
$$

Setting $a = t^{-1}$, $z = t^{1/2} - t^{-1/2}$ recovers the Jones polynomial. Setting $a = 1$ recovers the Alexander polynomial.

## Applications

- **Biology:** DNA topology — enzymes (topoisomerases) change DNA knot type, and knot invariants help classify DNA configurations.
- **Chemistry:** Molecular knots — synthetic molecules tied in knot configurations.
- **Physics:** Topological quantum computation — anyonic braiding in topological quantum computers.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Knots** are studied via diagrams and **Reidemeister moves**.
2. The **Jones polynomial** is a powerful invariant connected to quantum field theory.
3. Classical invariants (knot group, Alexander polynomial) are more computable but less discriminating.
4. Knot theory connects to **biology** (DNA), **physics** (TQFT), and **quantum computing**.
