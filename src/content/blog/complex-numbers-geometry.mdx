## Introduction

Complex numbers are not just algebraic objects — they are **geometric transformations**. Every complex number $z = x + iy$ corresponds to a point $(x, y)$ in the plane, and every operation on complex numbers has a geometric meaning.

## Basic Operations as Geometry

**Addition:** Translation by vector $(a, b)$ when adding $a + bi$.

**Multiplication by $re^{i\theta}$:** Scale by $r$ and rotate by $\theta$.

$$
z \mapsto re^{i\theta} z \quad \text{is rotation by } \theta \text{ and scaling by } r
$$

**Conjugation:** $z \mapsto \bar{z}$ is reflection across the real axis.

## Möbius Transformations

A **Möbius transformation** is:

$$
f(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}, \quad ad - bc \neq 0
$$

These map circles and lines to circles and lines, and are the **automorphisms of the Riemann sphere** $\mathbb{C} \cup \{\infty\}$.

They form a group isomorphic to $\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{C}) = \text{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) / \{\pm I\}$.

## Rotations in 3D via Quaternions

Complex numbers handle 2D rotations. For 3D, we need **quaternions** $\mathbb{H}$:

$$
q = a + bi + cj + dk, \quad i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1
$$

A unit quaternion $q$ with $|q| = 1$ acts on $\mathbb{R}^3$ by $v \mapsto qv\bar{q}$, giving all rotations.

## Key Takeaways

1. Multiplication by $e^{i\theta}$ is rotation — the deepest geometric fact about complex numbers.
2. Möbius transformations preserve the "circular" structure of the Riemann sphere.
3. Quaternions extend complex rotations to three dimensions.
