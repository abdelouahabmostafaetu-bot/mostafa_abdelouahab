## Introduction

**Euler's formula** for convex polyhedra states:

$$
V - E + F = 2
$$

where $V$ = vertices, $E$ = edges, $F$ = faces. This deceptively simple equation is one of the founding results of **topology**.

## Verification

| Polyhedron | $V$ | $E$ | $F$ | $V - E + F$ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tetrahedron | 4 | 6 | 4 | 2 |
| Cube | 8 | 12 | 6 | 2 |
| Octahedron | 6 | 12 | 8 | 2 |
| Dodecahedron | 20 | 30 | 12 | 2 |
| Icosahedron | 12 | 30 | 20 | 2 |

## Proof Sketch

Remove one face and flatten the remaining surface onto the plane. The result is a planar graph with $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F - 1$ faces (including the outer face). By induction on edges (triangulating, then removing):

$$
V - E + (F - 1) = 1 \implies V - E + F = 2
$$

## The Euler Characteristic

For a general surface $\Sigma$, the **Euler characteristic** $\chi(\Sigma) = V - E + F$ is a topological invariant:

$$
\chi(S^2) = 2, \quad \chi(T^2) = 0, \quad \chi(\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g
$$

where $\Sigma_g$ is the surface of genus $g$ (a "donut with $g$ holes").

## Key Takeaways

1. $V - E + F = 2$ holds for any convex polyhedron, regardless of shape.
2. The Euler characteristic is a **topological invariant** — it doesn't change under continuous deformation.
3. This formula connects combinatorics, geometry, and topology in a single equation.
