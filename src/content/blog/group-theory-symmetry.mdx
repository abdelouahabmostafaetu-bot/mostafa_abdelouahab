## Introduction

**Group theory** is the mathematical study of symmetry. Whether we're analyzing the rotations of a crystal, the permutations of a set, or the structure of a Rubik's cube, groups provide the algebraic framework that captures the essence of symmetry. As Hermann Weyl wrote:

> *"Symmetry, as wide or as narrow as you may define its meaning, is one idea by which man through the ages has tried to comprehend and create order, beauty, and perfection."*

## Definition

A **group** is a pair $(G, \cdot)$ where $G$ is a set and $\cdot : G \times G \to G$ is a binary operation satisfying:

1. **Associativity:** $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$ for all $a, b, c \in G$
2. **Identity:** There exists $e \in G$ such that $e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a$ for all $a \in G$
3. **Inverses:** For each $a \in G$, there exists $a^{-1} \in G$ such that $a \cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \cdot a = e$

If additionally $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$ for all $a, b$, the group is **abelian** (commutative).

## Fundamental Examples

### The Integers $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$

The simplest infinite group. Identity is $0$, inverse of $n$ is $-n$.

### The Symmetric Group $S_n$

The group of all permutations of $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ under composition. It has $n!$ elements and is non-abelian for $n \geq 3$.

### The Dihedral Group $D_n$

The symmetries of a regular $n$-gon, including $n$ rotations and $n$ reflections:

$$
|D_n| = 2n
$$

### The General Linear Group $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{R})$

The group of invertible $n \times n$ real matrices under multiplication.

### Cyclic Groups

$\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} = \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$ under addition modulo $n$. Every cyclic group is abelian, and every group of prime order is cyclic.

## Subgroups and Cosets

A subset $H \subseteq G$ is a **subgroup** if it is itself a group under the same operation. We write $H \leq G$.

**Subgroup Test:** $H \leq G$ if and only if $H \neq \emptyset$ and $ab^{-1} \in H$ for all $a, b \in H$.

For $H \leq G$ and $a \in G$, the **left coset** of $H$ is:

$$
aH = \{ah : h \in H\}
$$

The set of all left cosets is $G/H$, and the number of cosets is the **index** $[G : H]$.

## Lagrange's Theorem

**Theorem.** If $G$ is a finite group and $H \leq G$, then $|H|$ divides $|G|$. Moreover:

$$
|G| = |H| \cdot [G : H]
$$

### Consequences

1. The order of every element divides $|G|$.
2. Every group of prime order $p$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$.
3. **Fermat's Little Theorem:** If $p$ is prime and $\gcd(a, p) = 1$, then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.

## Normal Subgroups and Quotient Groups

A subgroup $N \leq G$ is **normal** (written $N \trianglelefteq G$) if:

$$
gNg^{-1} = N \quad \forall\, g \in G
$$

When $N$ is normal, the quotient $G/N$ forms a group under coset multiplication:

$$
(aN)(bN) = (ab)N
$$

### The First Isomorphism Theorem

If $\varphi: G \to H$ is a group homomorphism, then:

$$
G / \ker(\varphi) \cong \text{Im}(\varphi)
$$

This is one of the most useful results in algebra.

## Classification of Finite Abelian Groups

**Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups.** Every finite abelian group $G$ is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups:

$$
G \cong \mathbb{Z}/n_1\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/n_2\mathbb{Z} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}/n_k\mathbb{Z}
$$

where $n_1 | n_2 | \cdots | n_k$.

For example, every abelian group of order $12$ is isomorphic to either $\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$.

## Key Takeaways

1. Groups capture the **algebraic essence of symmetry** in a precise, abstract framework.
2. **Lagrange's theorem** is the first fundamental restriction on the structure of finite groups.
3. **Normal subgroups** allow us to construct quotient groups, decomposing complex groups into simpler pieces.
4. Group theory connects deeply to number theory, geometry, physics, and cryptography.
