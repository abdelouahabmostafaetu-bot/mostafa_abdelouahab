## Introduction

The **Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**, also known as the **Contraction Mapping Principle**, is one of the most important results in analysis. It provides a constructive method for finding fixed points of certain mappings and is fundamental in proving existence and uniqueness theorems for differential equations, integral equations, and many problems in applied mathematics.

## The Setting

Let $(X, d)$ be a **complete metric space**. A mapping $T: X \to X$ is called a **contraction** if there exists a constant $0 \leq k < 1$ such that:

$$
d(T(x), T(y)) \leq k \cdot d(x, y) \quad \forall\, x, y \in X
$$

The constant $k$ is called the **contraction constant** or **Lipschitz constant** of $T$.

## Statement of the Theorem

**Theorem (Banach, 1922).** Let $(X, d)$ be a complete metric space and let $T: X \to X$ be a contraction mapping with contraction constant $k \in [0, 1)$. Then:

1. $T$ has a **unique** fixed point $x^* \in X$, i.e., $T(x^*) = x^*$.
2. For any initial point $x_0 \in X$, the sequence of **iterates** $x_{n+1} = T(x_n)$ converges to $x^*$.
3. The **error estimate** holds:

$$
d(x_n, x^*) \leq \frac{k^n}{1-k} \, d(x_0, x_1)
$$

## Proof

### Existence

Choose any $x_0 \in X$ and define the sequence recursively: $x_{n+1} = T(x_n)$.

**Step 1.** We show that $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence. First, observe:

$$
d(x_{n+1}, x_n) = d(T(x_n), T(x_{n-1})) \leq k \cdot d(x_n, x_{n-1}) \leq \cdots \leq k^n \cdot d(x_1, x_0)
$$

For $m > n$, by the triangle inequality:

$$
d(x_m, x_n) \leq \sum_{i=n}^{m-1} d(x_{i+1}, x_i) \leq \sum_{i=n}^{m-1} k^i \cdot d(x_1, x_0) \leq \frac{k^n}{1-k} \cdot d(x_1, x_0)
$$

Since $k < 1$, the right side tends to $0$ as $n \to \infty$. Hence $(x_n)$ is Cauchy.

**Step 2.** Since $X$ is complete, there exists $x^* \in X$ such that $x_n \to x^*$.

**Step 3.** We show $x^*$ is a fixed point:

$$
d(T(x^*), x^*) \leq d(T(x^*), T(x_n)) + d(T(x_n), x^*) \leq k \cdot d(x^*, x_n) + d(x_{n+1}, x^*) \to 0
$$

Therefore $T(x^*) = x^*$.

### Uniqueness

Suppose $y^*$ is another fixed point. Then:

$$
d(x^*, y^*) = d(T(x^*), T(y^*)) \leq k \cdot d(x^*, y^*)
$$

Since $k < 1$, this implies $d(x^*, y^*) = 0$, so $x^* = y^*$. $\blacksquare$

## Application: Existence of Solutions to ODEs

Consider the initial value problem:

$$
y'(t) = f(t, y(t)), \quad y(t_0) = y_0
$$

If $f$ is Lipschitz continuous in $y$, we can reformulate this as an integral equation:

$$
y(t) = y_0 + \int_{t_0}^{t} f(s, y(s)) \, ds
$$

Define the operator $T$ on $C([t_0 - \delta, t_0 + \delta])$ by:

$$
(Ty)(t) = y_0 + \int_{t_0}^{t} f(s, y(s)) \, ds
$$

For sufficiently small $\delta$, $T$ is a contraction, and the Banach theorem guarantees a unique solution — this is the essence of the **Picard–Lindelöf theorem**.

## A Concrete Example

Consider the equation $x = \cos(x)$. Define $T(x) = \cos(x)$ on $[0, 1]$.

Since $|T'(x)| = |\sin(x)| \leq \sin(1) \approx 0.841 < 1$, $T$ is a contraction.

Starting from $x_0 = 0$:

| $n$ | $x_n$ |
|---|---|
| 0 | $0$ |
| 1 | $1$ |
| 2 | $0.5403$ |
| 3 | $0.8576$ |
| 10 | $0.7391$ |
| 50 | $0.7391$ |

The fixed point is $x^* \approx 0.7390851332$, known as the **Dottie number**.

## Key Takeaways

1. The Banach theorem requires **completeness** — without it, the sequence of iterates may not converge.
2. The contraction condition is **sufficient** but not necessary: a mapping may have a unique fixed point without being a contraction.
3. The theorem is **constructive**: it gives an explicit algorithm (iteration) and error bounds.
4. Extensions include the **Brouwer** and **Schauder** fixed-point theorems, which relax the contraction condition at the cost of losing uniqueness and constructiveness.
