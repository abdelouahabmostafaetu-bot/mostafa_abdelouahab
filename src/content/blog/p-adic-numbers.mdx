## Introduction

Most mathematicians first encounter one completion of $\mathbb{Q}$: the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, constructed via Cauchy sequences with the usual absolute value. But the rationals admit infinitely many other completions — one for each prime $p$ — giving rise to the **$p$-adic numbers** $\mathbb{Q}_p$. In this alternative world, "closeness" is measured by **divisibility by $p$**, and the resulting geometry is radically different from the real line.

## The $p$-adic Absolute Value

For a prime $p$, every nonzero rational $x = p^v \cdot \frac{a}{b}$ (with $p \nmid ab$) has a **$p$-adic valuation**:

$$
v_p(x) = v
$$

The **$p$-adic absolute value** is:

$$
|x|_p = p^{-v_p(x)}, \quad |0|_p = 0
$$

**Key principle:** A number is "$p$-adically small" when it is **highly divisible by $p$**.

**Examples ($p = 5$):**
- $|25|_5 = |5^2|_5 = 5^{-2} = 1/25$ (small — very divisible by 5)
- $|1/5|_5 = 5^1 = 5$ (large)
- $|7|_5 = 1$ (neither divisible by 5 nor a denominator involving 5)

This is the opposite of the usual intuition: $p^n \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$ in $\mathbb{Q}_p$.

## Ostrowski's Theorem

**Theorem (Ostrowski).** Every nontrivial absolute value on $\mathbb{Q}$ is equivalent to either the usual absolute value $|\cdot|$ or a $p$-adic absolute value $|\cdot|_p$ for some prime $p$.

This means the "number line" $\mathbb{R}$ and the "$p$-adic lines" $\mathbb{Q}_p$ are the only ways to complete $\mathbb{Q}$. The **product formula** ties them together: for every $x \in \mathbb{Q}^*$:

$$
|x| \cdot \prod_p |x|_p = 1
$$

## Ultrametric Geometry

The $p$-adic absolute value satisfies the **ultrametric inequality** — stronger than the triangle inequality:

$$
|x + y|_p \leq \max(|x|_p, |y|_p)
$$

with equality when $|x|_p \neq |y|_p$.

### Strange Consequences

1. **Every triangle is isosceles.** If $|x|_p \neq |y|_p$, then $|x+y|_p = \max(|x|_p, |y|_p)$.

2. **Every point of a disk is a center.** If $|x - a|_p \leq r$, then $B(x, r) = B(a, r)$.

3. **Disks are both open and closed** (clopen).

4. $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is **totally disconnected** — the connected components are single points.

## Construction of $\mathbb{Q}_p$

Like $\mathbb{R}$, the $p$-adic numbers are the **completion** of $\mathbb{Q}$ with respect to $|\cdot|_p$: equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences.

Alternatively, $\mathbb{Q}_p$ consists of formal **Laurent series in $p$**:

$$
x = \sum_{n=v}^{\infty} a_n p^n, \quad 0 \leq a_n \leq p-1, \quad v \in \mathbb{Z}
$$

The **$p$-adic integers** $\mathbb{Z}_p = \{x \in \mathbb{Q}_p : |x|_p \leq 1\}$ are the "power series":

$$
\mathbb{Z}_p = \left\{\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n p^n : 0 \leq a_n \leq p-1\right\}
$$

**Example ($p = 3$).** The element $-1 \in \mathbb{Z}_3$ has the expansion:

$$
-1 = 2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^3 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty 2 \cdot 3^n
$$

Check: $1 + (2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + \cdots) = 3 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + \cdots = 3(1 + 2 + 2 \cdot 3 + \cdots) \to 0$ in $\mathbb{Z}_3$.

## Hensel's Lemma

**Theorem (Hensel).** If $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}_p[x]$ and there exists $a_0 \in \mathbb{Z}_p$ with:

$$
|f(a_0)|_p < |f'(a_0)|_p^2
$$

then there exists a unique $a \in \mathbb{Z}_p$ with $f(a) = 0$ and $|a - a_0|_p \leq |f(a_0)/f'(a_0)|_p$.

**Hensel's lemma** is the $p$-adic analogue of Newton's method — it "lifts" approximate roots to exact roots. It's the key tool for solving equations in $\mathbb{Q}_p$.

**Application.** Does $x^2 = -1$ have a solution in $\mathbb{Q}_5$?

Since $2^2 = 4 \equiv -1 \pmod{5}$ and $f'(2) = 4 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{5}$, Hensel's lemma gives: **yes**, $\sqrt{-1} \in \mathbb{Q}_5$. The 5-adic numbers contain $i$!

## The Hasse–Minkowski Theorem

**Theorem.** A quadratic form $Q$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ represents zero nontrivially if and only if it represents zero over $\mathbb{R}$ **and** over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for every prime $p$.

This **local-global principle** says that solvability over $\mathbb{Q}$ can be checked by testing over all completions. It's a stunning example of how $p$-adic numbers illuminate rational arithmetic.

## Topology of $\mathbb{Z}_p$

As a topological space, $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is:

- **Compact** (it's a closed ball of radius 1)
- **Totally disconnected** and **perfect** (no isolated points)
- Homeomorphic to the **Cantor set**!

The Haar measure on $\mathbb{Z}_p$ normalizes $\mu(\mathbb{Z}_p) = 1$ and gives $\mu(a + p^n\mathbb{Z}_p) = p^{-n}$.

## Key Takeaways

1. The **$p$-adic numbers** $\mathbb{Q}_p$ are a completion of $\mathbb{Q}$ where closeness means divisibility by $p$.
2. The **ultrametric inequality** creates exotic geometry: every triangle is isosceles.
3. **Hensel's lemma** lifts approximate solutions to exact ones — the $p$-adic Newton's method.
4. The **local-global principle** connects $p$-adic and real solvability to rational solvability.
