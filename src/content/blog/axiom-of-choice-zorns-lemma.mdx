## Introduction

The **axiom of choice** (AC) is the most discussed, debated, and consequential axiom of modern mathematics. It asserts, simply, that given any collection of nonempty sets, we can simultaneously choose one element from each. This seemingly innocuous statement has profound and sometimes startling consequences — from the existence of bases for all vector spaces to the Banach–Tarski paradox.

## The Axiom of Choice

**Axiom of Choice.** For every family $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ of nonempty sets, there exists a **choice function** $f: I \to \bigcup A_i$ with $f(i) \in A_i$ for all $i$.

Equivalently: $\prod_{i \in I} A_i \neq \emptyset$ whenever each $A_i \neq \emptyset$.

For **finite** families, AC is provable from the other ZF axioms. The axiom is needed only for **infinite** families, where no explicit rule for choosing may exist.

## Zorn's Lemma

**Zorn's Lemma.** If every chain (totally ordered subset) in a partially ordered set $(P, \leq)$ has an upper bound in $P$, then $P$ has a **maximal element**.

**Theorem.** Zorn's lemma is equivalent to the axiom of choice (in ZF).

### Applications of Zorn's Lemma

Zorn's lemma is the primary tool for proving existence theorems in algebra and analysis:

**1. Every vector space has a basis.** Consider the poset of linearly independent subsets, ordered by inclusion. Every chain has an upper bound (the union). By Zorn, a maximal linearly independent set exists — and it must span, i.e., it is a basis.

**2. Hahn–Banach theorem.** Extend a bounded linear functional to the whole space by considering all possible extensions.

**3. Every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal.** (Crucial for commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.)

**4. Tychonoff's theorem** (arbitrary products of compact spaces are compact).

**5. Every field has an algebraic closure.**

## The Well-Ordering Theorem

**Theorem (Zermelo, 1904).** Every set can be well-ordered.

A **well-ordering** of a set $S$ is a total order such that every nonempty subset has a least element.

This is equivalent to AC, yet it feels far more surprising: it implies that $\mathbb{R}$ can be well-ordered, even though no one can explicitly construct such an ordering!

**The equivalencies:**

$$
\text{AC} \iff \text{Zorn's Lemma} \iff \text{Well-Ordering Theorem}
$$

## Consequences of AC

### Algebra

- Every vector space has a **Hamel basis**.
- Every surjective function has a **right inverse** (section).
- Every nontrivial ring has a **maximal ideal**.
- The **algebraic closure** of any field exists and is unique up to isomorphism.

### Analysis

- The **Hahn–Banach theorem** — extending linear functionals.
- The **Banach–Tarski paradox** — a sphere can be decomposed into 5 pieces and reassembled into two spheres of the same size.
- The existence of **non-measurable sets** (Vitali, 1905).
- Every Hilbert space has an **orthonormal basis**.

### Topology

- **Tychonoff's theorem** — arbitrary products of compact spaces are compact.
- The **Stone–Čech compactification** exists.
- Every filter can be extended to an **ultrafilter**.

## The Banach–Tarski Paradox

**Theorem (Banach–Tarski, 1924).** A solid ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be partitioned into finitely many (5 suffice) pieces which can be reassembled by rigid motions into **two** solid balls, each the same size as the original.

This seems to violate conservation of volume — but the pieces are **non-measurable sets**, so they have no well-defined volume. The paradox is a direct consequence of AC.

**Key ingredients:** The proof uses the fact that the free group $F_2$ embeds in $SO(3)$ (the group of rotations), creating a **paradoxical decomposition** of the sphere.

**In dimensions 1 and 2,** the Banach–Tarski paradox fails because the isometry groups are **amenable** (they admit an invariant finitely additive measure).

## Non-Measurable Sets

**Theorem (Vitali, 1905).** Assuming AC, there exists a subset of $[0,1]$ that is not Lebesgue measurable.

**Construction:** Define an equivalence relation on $[0,1]$ by $x \sim y$ iff $x - y \in \mathbb{Q}$. By AC, choose one representative from each equivalence class. The resulting set $V$ is non-measurable: if it had measure $m$, then $[0,1] \subseteq \bigcup_{q \in \mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]} (V + q)$, giving $1 \leq \sum m = \aleph_0 \cdot m$, which is impossible for any $m$.

## Without the Axiom of Choice

What happens if we **reject** AC? In ZF without AC:

- There exist vector spaces with **no basis**.
- There exist surjections with **no right inverse**.
- $\mathbb{R}$ might not be well-orderable.
- Every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ could be **Lebesgue measurable** (consistent with ZF + DC, by Solovay's model).
- The Banach–Tarski paradox **fails**.

The **axiom of determinacy** (AD) is an alternative to AC that implies all sets of reals are measurable — but it contradicts AC.

## Weaker Forms

- **Countable choice** (AC$_\omega$): Choice for countable families. Sufficient for most of analysis.
- **Dependent choice** (DC): Sufficient for measure theory and functional analysis.
- **Boolean prime ideal theorem** (BPI): Weaker than AC, sufficient for ultrafilter lemma and compactness theorem in logic.

## Key Takeaways

1. The **axiom of choice** guarantees the existence of choice functions for arbitrary families.
2. It is equivalent to **Zorn's lemma** and the **well-ordering theorem**.
3. AC enables fundamental results (Hahn–Banach, Tychonoff, bases) but also **paradoxes** (Banach–Tarski, non-measurable sets).
4. Most "everyday" mathematics uses only **countable choice** or **dependent choice**.
