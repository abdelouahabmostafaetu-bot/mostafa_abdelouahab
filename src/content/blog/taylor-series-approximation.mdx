## Introduction

**Taylor series** are one of the most important tools in mathematics: they allow us to represent complicated functions as infinite polynomials, making computation, approximation, and theoretical analysis possible. In this post, we develop the theory rigorously and explore its most elegant applications.

## Taylor's Theorem

**Theorem.** If $f$ is $(n+1)$-times differentiable on an interval containing $a$, then for any $x$ in this interval:

$$
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k + R_n(x)
$$

where the **Lagrange remainder** is:

$$
R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}
$$

for some $c$ between $a$ and $x$.

When $R_n(x) \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$, the **Taylor series** converges:

$$
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k
$$

## Classical Taylor Series

### The Exponential Function

$$
e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots
$$

Convergent for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ (entire function). Setting $x = 1$:

$$
e = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} \approx 2.71828\ldots
$$

### Trigonometric Functions

$$
\sin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots
$$

$$
\cos(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n}}{(2n)!} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \cdots
$$

Both converge for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

### The Natural Logarithm

$$
\ln(1+x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1} x^n}{n} = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots
$$

Convergent for $-1 < x \leq 1$. The radius of convergence is $R = 1$.

### The Binomial Series

For any $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$:

$$
(1+x)^\alpha = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \binom{\alpha}{n} x^n
$$

where $\binom{\alpha}{n} = \frac{\alpha(\alpha-1)\cdots(\alpha-n+1)}{n!}$. Convergent for $|x| < 1$.

## Radius of Convergence

The **radius of convergence** of $\sum a_n (x - a)^n$ is:

$$
R = \frac{1}{\limsup_{n \to \infty} |a_n|^{1/n}}
$$

Or equivalently, by the **ratio test**: $R = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left|\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}\right|$ when this limit exists.

| Series | $R$ |
|---|---|
| $e^x$ | $\infty$ |
| $\sin x$, $\cos x$ | $\infty$ |
| $\ln(1+x)$ | $1$ |
| $\frac{1}{1-x}$ | $1$ |
| $(1+x)^\alpha$ | $1$ |

## Euler's Identity

From the Taylor series of $e^x$, $\sin x$, and $\cos x$, extending to complex arguments yields:

$$
e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x
$$

Setting $x = \pi$:

$$
\boxed{e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0}
$$

**Euler's identity** — connecting the five most important constants in mathematics: $e$, $i$, $\pi$, $1$, and $0$.

## A Cautionary Tale: Non-Analytic Functions

Not every smooth function equals its Taylor series. The classic example:

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases} e^{-1/x^2} & x \neq 0 \\ 0 & x = 0 \end{cases}
$$

This function is $C^\infty$ and $f^{(n)}(0) = 0$ for all $n$, so its Taylor series at $0$ is identically $0$ — but $f(x) > 0$ for $x \neq 0$. The Taylor series converges, but **not to $f$**.

Such functions are called **smooth but non-analytic**.

## Application: Computing $\pi$

The Maclaurin series for $\arctan$:

$$
\arctan(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{2n+1}
$$

Using **Machin's formula** $\frac{\pi}{4} = 4\arctan\frac{1}{5} - \arctan\frac{1}{239}$:

This converges rapidly and was used to compute $\pi$ to hundreds of digits before the computer age.

## Key Takeaways

1. Taylor series reduce complex functions to **polynomial arithmetic**.
2. The **remainder term** controls approximation quality and determines when the series converges to the function.
3. The **radius of convergence** is determined by the nearest singularity in the complex plane.
4. Not all smooth functions are analytic — the gap between $C^\infty$ and $C^\omega$ is real and important.
