## Introduction

In 1931, Kurt Gödel proved two theorems that shook the foundations of mathematics. They showed that the dream of a complete, consistent axiomatization of mathematics is **impossible**.

## The First Incompleteness Theorem

**Theorem (Gödel, 1931).** Any consistent formal system $F$ that can express basic arithmetic is **incomplete**: there exists a statement $G$ that is true but unprovable in $F$.

The key idea: Gödel constructs a sentence $G$ that essentially says:

$$
G: \text{"This sentence is not provable in } F\text{"}
$$

If $G$ is provable, then $G$ is false (since it says it's not provable), making $F$ inconsistent. So if $F$ is consistent, $G$ is not provable. But then $G$ is true! So $G$ is true but unprovable. $\square$

## The Second Incompleteness Theorem

**Theorem.** No consistent formal system $F$ that can express basic arithmetic can prove its own consistency.

If $F$ could prove "$F$ is consistent," then $F$ could prove $G$ (since the proof above is formalizable). But $G$ is unprovable in consistent $F$. Contradiction.

## Consequences

1. **No complete axiomatization of arithmetic exists** — there will always be true but unprovable statements.
2. **Mathematics cannot prove its own consistency** from within.
3. **Truth and provability are different** — a profound philosophical insight.

## Key Takeaways

1. Gödel's theorems set fundamental limits on what formal systems can achieve.
2. The diagonal/self-reference technique is the key proof mechanism.
3. The theorems do not say mathematics is broken — they say it is inexhaustibly rich.
