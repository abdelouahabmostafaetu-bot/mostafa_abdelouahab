## Introduction

The **Pythagorean theorem** states that for a right triangle with legs $a, b$ and hypotenuse $c$:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

It has been proved in over 371 ways. We present several of the most elegant.

## Proof 1: Rearrangement

Arrange four copies of the right triangle inside a square of side $a + b$. The inner shape is a square of side $c$:

$$
(a+b)^2 = c^2 + 4 \cdot \frac{ab}{2} \implies a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = c^2 + 2ab \implies a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

## Proof 2: Similar Triangles (Euclid)

Drop the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse, creating two smaller triangles similar to the original:

$$
\frac{a}{c} = \frac{e}{a} \implies a^2 = ce \qquad \frac{b}{c} = \frac{f}{b} \implies b^2 = cf
$$

Adding: $a^2 + b^2 = c(e + f) = c \cdot c = c^2$. $\square$

## Proof 3: Inner Product (Modern)

In $\mathbb{R}^2$, for orthogonal vectors $\mathbf{u} \perp \mathbf{v}$:

$$
\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|^2 = \langle \mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v} \rangle = \|\mathbf{u}\|^2 + 2\underbrace{\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}\rangle}_{=0} + \|\mathbf{v}\|^2
$$

## Pythagorean Triples

Integer solutions $(a, b, c)$ are given by: $a = m^2 - n^2$, $b = 2mn$, $c = m^2 + n^2$ for $m > n > 0$ with $\gcd(m,n) = 1$ and $m \not\equiv n \pmod{2}$.

## Key Takeaways

1. The Pythagorean theorem is equivalent to the parallel postulate in neutral geometry.
2. It generalizes to inner product spaces: $\|u+v\|^2 = \|u\|^2 + \|v\|^2$ when $u \perp v$.
3. Pythagorean triples connect geometry to number theory.
