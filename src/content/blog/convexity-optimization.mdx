## Introduction

A function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is **convex** if:

$$
f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y) \leq \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda)f(y), \quad \forall \lambda \in [0,1]
$$

The central miracle of convexity: **every local minimum is a global minimum**.

## Characterizations

For $C^2$ functions, convexity is equivalent to:

$$
\nabla^2 f(x) \succeq 0 \quad \forall x \quad \text{(Hessian is positive semidefinite)}
$$

**Strict convexity:** $\nabla^2 f(x) \succ 0$ ensures the minimum is unique.

**Strong convexity:** $f(x) - \frac{m}{2}\|x\|^2$ is convex for some $m > 0$, giving:

$$
f(y) \geq f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T(y-x) + \frac{m}{2}\|y-x\|^2
$$

## Jensen's Inequality

For convex $f$ and random variable $X$:

$$
f(\mathbb{E}[X]) \leq \mathbb{E}[f(X)]
$$

This single inequality implies AM-GM, Cauchy-Schwarz, and many classical inequalities.

## Convex Optimization

**Problem:** Minimize $f(x)$ subject to $g_i(x) \leq 0$, $h_j(x) = 0$.

If $f$ and $g_i$ are convex and $h_j$ are affine, this is a **convex program**. The KKT conditions are necessary **and sufficient**:

$$
\nabla f(x^*) + \sum_i \mu_i \nabla g_i(x^*) + \sum_j \lambda_j \nabla h_j(x^*) = 0
$$

## Key Takeaways

1. Convexity guarantees local = global, making optimization tractable.
2. Jensen's inequality is the master inequality from which many classical results follow.
3. Convex optimization has polynomial-time algorithms — a triumph of mathematical structure.
