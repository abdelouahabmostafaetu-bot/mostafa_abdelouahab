## Introduction

The **Riemann zeta function** is perhaps the most important function in all of mathematics. Defined initially by a simple series, it encodes the deepest secrets about prime numbers and connects analysis, algebra, and number theory in surprising ways. Understanding this function is key to one of the greatest unsolved problems: the **Riemann Hypothesis**.

## Definition

For $\text{Re}(s) > 1$, the zeta function is defined by the **Dirichlet series**:

$$
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}
$$

This series converges absolutely for $\text{Re}(s) > 1$ and defines an analytic function in this half-plane.

### Special Values

Some classical evaluations:

$$
\zeta(2) = \frac{\pi^2}{6}, \quad \zeta(4) = \frac{\pi^4}{90}, \quad \zeta(6) = \frac{\pi^6}{945}
$$

More generally, Euler showed that for even positive integers:

$$
\zeta(2n) = \frac{(-1)^{n+1} B_{2n} (2\pi)^{2n}}{2(2n)!}
$$

where $B_{2n}$ are the **Bernoulli numbers**.

## The Euler Product

The deep connection to primes comes from Euler's remarkable identity:

$$
\zeta(s) = \prod_{p \text{ prime}} \frac{1}{1 - p^{-s}} \quad \text{for } \text{Re}(s) > 1
$$

**Proof sketch:** Expand each factor as a geometric series:

$$
\frac{1}{1 - p^{-s}} = 1 + p^{-s} + p^{-2s} + \cdots
$$

Multiplying over all primes and using the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** (unique factorization), each term $n^{-s}$ appears exactly once.

### Consequence: Infinitude of Primes

If there were only finitely many primes, the Euler product would be a finite product, hence finite at $s = 1$. But $\zeta(1) = \sum 1/n = \infty$, giving a contradiction. This is **Euler's analytic proof** of the infinitude of primes.

## Analytic Continuation

The zeta function can be extended to all of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{1\}$, with a **simple pole** at $s = 1$ with residue $1$.

One approach uses the identity:

$$
\zeta(s) = \frac{1}{1 - 2^{1-s}} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^s}
$$

The alternating series on the right (the **Dirichlet eta function**) converges for $\text{Re}(s) > 0$, extending $\zeta$ to this larger region.

## The Functional Equation

The zeta function satisfies a beautiful symmetry:

$$
\zeta(s) = 2^s \pi^{s-1} \sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right) \Gamma(1-s) \zeta(1-s)
$$

This relates values at $s$ to values at $1-s$, connecting the two halves of the complex plane.

Defining the **completed zeta function**:

$$
\xi(s) = \frac{1}{2} s(s-1) \pi^{-s/2} \Gamma(s/2) \zeta(s)
$$

the functional equation takes the elegant form: $\xi(s) = \xi(1-s)$.

## The Riemann Hypothesis

The **trivial zeros** of $\zeta$ are at $s = -2, -4, -6, \ldots$ (arising from the $\sin(\pi s/2)$ factor).

All other zeros lie in the **critical strip** $0 < \text{Re}(s) < 1$.

**Riemann Hypothesis (1859).** All non-trivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$ lie on the **critical line** $\text{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}$.

This conjecture, if true, would imply the strongest possible estimates for the distribution of prime numbers. It remains unproven after more than 160 years and carries a $1,000,000 prize from the Clay Mathematics Institute.

## Connection to Prime Counting

The **prime counting function** $\pi(x) = \#\{p \leq x : p \text{ prime}\}$ is related to $\zeta$ through the **explicit formula**:

$$
\pi(x) \sim \text{Li}(x) - \sum_{\rho} \text{Li}(x^\rho) + \text{(smaller terms)}
$$

where $\rho$ ranges over the non-trivial zeros of $\zeta$. The Riemann Hypothesis would imply:

$$
\pi(x) = \text{Li}(x) + O(\sqrt{x} \log x)
$$

the best possible error term in the **Prime Number Theorem**.

## Key Takeaways

1. The zeta function bridges **analysis** and **number theory** through the Euler product.
2. **Analytic continuation** extends $\zeta$ from a simple series to a function on all of $\mathbb{C}$.
3. The **functional equation** reveals a deep symmetry in $\zeta$.
4. The **Riemann Hypothesis** — about the zeros of $\zeta$ — is one of the most important open problems in mathematics.
