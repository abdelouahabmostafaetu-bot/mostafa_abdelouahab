## Introduction

Metric spaces provide the natural setting for analysis. They generalize the notion of distance from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to abstract spaces, allowing us to discuss convergence, continuity, and compactness in a unified framework. In this post, we develop the topology of metric spaces from the ground up.

## Definitions and First Properties

A **metric space** is a pair $(X, d)$ where $X$ is a set and $d: X \times X \to [0, \infty)$ satisfies:

1. **Positive definiteness:** $d(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y$
2. **Symmetry:** $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$
3. **Triangle inequality:** $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$

### Fundamental Examples

| Space | Metric |
|---|---|
| $\mathbb{R}^n$ | $d(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum (x_i - y_i)^2}$ |
| $C([a,b])$ | $d(f,g) = \sup_{x \in [a,b]} \|f(x) - g(x)\|$ |
| $\ell^p$ | $d(x,y) = \left(\sum \|x_n - y_n\|^p\right)^{1/p}$ |
| Discrete | $d(x,y) = \begin{cases} 0 & x=y \\ 1 & x \neq y \end{cases}$ |

## Open and Closed Sets

The **open ball** of radius $r > 0$ centered at $x$ is:

$$
B(x, r) = \{y \in X : d(x, y) < r\}
$$

A set $U \subseteq X$ is **open** if for every $x \in U$, there exists $r > 0$ such that $B(x, r) \subseteq U$.

**Proposition.** The collection $\tau$ of open sets in $(X, d)$ satisfies the axioms of a topology:
1. $\emptyset$ and $X$ are open.
2. Arbitrary unions of open sets are open.
3. Finite intersections of open sets are open.

A set $F$ is **closed** if its complement $X \setminus F$ is open, or equivalently, if it contains all its limit points.

## Convergence and Completeness

A sequence $(x_n)$ in $(X, d)$ **converges** to $x$ if $d(x_n, x) \to 0$.

A sequence is **Cauchy** if for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $N$ such that:

$$
m, n \geq N \implies d(x_m, x_n) < \varepsilon
$$

A metric space is **complete** if every Cauchy sequence converges.

**Key fact:** Every convergent sequence is Cauchy, but the converse fails in general. For example, $\mathbb{Q}$ with the standard metric is not complete — the sequence of partial sums of $e = \sum 1/n!$ is Cauchy in $\mathbb{Q}$ but does not converge in $\mathbb{Q}$.

## Compactness

A metric space $X$ is **compact** if every open cover has a finite subcover. In metric spaces, compactness is equivalent to several other conditions:

**Theorem.** For a metric space $(X, d)$, the following are equivalent:
1. $X$ is compact.
2. $X$ is **sequentially compact**: every sequence has a convergent subsequence.
3. $X$ is **complete** and **totally bounded**.

A set $A$ is **totally bounded** if for every $\varepsilon > 0$, $A$ can be covered by finitely many balls of radius $\varepsilon$.

### The Heine–Borel Theorem

In $\mathbb{R}^n$, compactness takes a particularly clean form:

$$
A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \text{ is compact} \iff A \text{ is closed and bounded}
$$

**Warning:** This equivalence fails in infinite-dimensional spaces. The closed unit ball in $\ell^2$ is closed and bounded but **not** compact.

## Connectedness

A metric space $X$ is **connected** if it cannot be written as a disjoint union of two nonempty open sets. Equivalently, $X$ is connected if the only subsets that are both open and closed are $\emptyset$ and $X$.

**Path connectedness** is a stronger property: $X$ is path connected if for any $x, y \in X$, there exists a continuous path $\gamma: [0,1] \to X$ with $\gamma(0) = x$ and $\gamma(1) = y$.

$$
\text{Path connected} \implies \text{Connected}
$$

The converse is false in general (the topologist's sine curve is a classical counterexample).

## Key Takeaways

1. Metric spaces provide the **minimal structure** needed to discuss convergence and continuity rigorously.
2. **Completeness** is about Cauchy sequences converging — it's essential for the Banach fixed-point theorem and many existence results.
3. **Compactness** is the topological replacement for finiteness — it allows us to extract finite information from infinite situations.
4. These concepts extend naturally to **topological spaces**, but metric spaces remain the most important source of intuition.
