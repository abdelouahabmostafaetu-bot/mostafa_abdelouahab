## Introduction

Euler's identity $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ has been called the most beautiful equation in mathematics. It connects five fundamental constants: $e$, $i$, $\pi$, $1$, and $0$ in a single elegant expression.

## Euler's Formula

The identity is a special case of **Euler's formula**:

$$
e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta
$$

Setting $\theta = \pi$: $e^{i\pi} = \cos\pi + i\sin\pi = -1 + 0 = -1$, hence $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$.

## Why the Exponential Function?

The complex exponential can be defined via the power series:

$$
e^z = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^n}{n!}
$$

Substituting $z = i\theta$ and separating real and imaginary parts:

$$
e^{i\theta} = \underbrace{\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k \theta^{2k}}{(2k)!}}_{\cos\theta} + i\underbrace{\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k \theta^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}}_{\sin\theta}
$$

## Geometric Interpretation

$e^{i\theta}$ traces the **unit circle** in the complex plane. Every complex number $z = re^{i\theta}$ is decomposed into magnitude $r$ and angle $\theta$. Multiplication by $e^{i\alpha}$ is rotation by angle $\alpha$.

## Applications

**De Moivre's Theorem:** $(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)^n = \cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta)$

**Roots of unity:** The $n$-th roots of unity are $e^{2\pi i k/n}$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1$, forming a regular $n$-gon on the unit circle.

$$
\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{2\pi i k/n} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \prod_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{2\pi i k/n} = (-1)^{n+1}
$$

## Key Takeaways

1. Euler's identity connects the five most important constants in a single equation.
2. The complex exponential $e^{i\theta}$ unifies trigonometry with exponential functions.
3. Geometrically, $e^{i\theta}$ is rotation on the unit circle.
