## Introduction

A **fractal** is a geometric object that exhibits **self-similarity** at every scale. Unlike smooth curves and surfaces, fractals have **fractional dimension** — they occupy more space than a line but less than a plane.

## Hausdorff Dimension

The **Hausdorff dimension** generalizes integer dimensions. For a self-similar set made of $N$ copies scaled by factor $r$:

$$
d_H = \frac{\log N}{\log(1/r)}
$$

**Examples:**
- Koch snowflake: $N = 4$, $r = 1/3$, so $d_H = \frac{\log 4}{\log 3} \approx 1.26$
- Sierpiński triangle: $N = 3$, $r = 1/2$, so $d_H = \frac{\log 3}{\log 2} \approx 1.58$
- Cantor set: $N = 2$, $r = 1/3$, so $d_H = \frac{\log 2}{\log 3} \approx 0.63$

## The Mandelbrot Set

The **Mandelbrot set** $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of complex numbers $c$ for which the iteration

$$
z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c, \quad z_0 = 0
$$

remains bounded (does not escape to infinity).

**Formally:** $\mathcal{M} = \{c \in \mathbb{C} : \sup_n |z_n| < \infty\}$.

**Key fact:** If $|z_n| > 2$ for some $n$, then $z_n \to \infty$, so $c \notin \mathcal{M}$.

The boundary of $\mathcal{M}$ has Hausdorff dimension exactly $2$ (Shishikura, 1998), making it as complex as a two-dimensional object despite being a one-dimensional curve.

## Julia Sets

For each $c$, the **Julia set** $J_c$ is the boundary between points whose orbits under $z \mapsto z^2 + c$ escape and those that don't. If $c \in \mathcal{M}$, $J_c$ is connected; otherwise it's a Cantor dust.

## Key Takeaways

1. Fractals have fractional Hausdorff dimension, capturing their "roughness."
2. The Mandelbrot set encodes infinite complexity in the simple iteration $z \mapsto z^2 + c$.
3. Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set are deeply connected: $\mathcal{M}$ is a "map" of all Julia sets.
