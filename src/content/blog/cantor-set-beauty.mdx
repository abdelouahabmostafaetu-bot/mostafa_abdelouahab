## Introduction

The **Cantor set** is one of the most fascinating objects in mathematics. Constructed by Georg Cantor in 1883, it is a set that defies intuition: it is simultaneously *very small* (measure zero) and *very large* (uncountable). It serves as a fundamental counterexample in analysis and topology, and it is one of the earliest examples of a **fractal**.

## Construction

The Cantor set $\mathcal{C}$ is constructed by iteratively removing the open middle third of intervals:

**Step 0:** Start with $C_0 = [0, 1]$.

**Step 1:** Remove the open middle third $\left(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right)$:

$$
C_1 = \left[0, \frac{1}{3}\right] \cup \left[\frac{2}{3}, 1\right]
$$

**Step 2:** Remove the middle third of each remaining interval:

$$
C_2 = \left[0, \frac{1}{9}\right] \cup \left[\frac{2}{9}, \frac{1}{3}\right] \cup \left[\frac{2}{3}, \frac{7}{9}\right] \cup \left[\frac{8}{9}, 1\right]
$$

**Step $n$:** $C_n$ consists of $2^n$ closed intervals, each of length $3^{-n}$.

The **Cantor set** is:

$$
\mathcal{C} = \bigcap_{n=0}^{\infty} C_n
$$

## Properties

### 1. Measure Zero

The total length removed is:

$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{2^n}{3^{n+1}} = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - 2/3} = 1
$$

Therefore $\mathcal{C}$ has **Lebesgue measure zero**: $\lambda(\mathcal{C}) = 0$. We have removed "everything."

### 2. Uncountability

Despite having measure zero, $\mathcal{C}$ is **uncountable**. Every element of $\mathcal{C}$ can be written in base 3 using only the digits $0$ and $2$:

$$
x \in \mathcal{C} \iff x = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{3^n}, \quad a_n \in \{0, 2\}
$$

The map $\varphi: \mathcal{C} \to [0,1]$ defined by $a_n \mapsto a_n/2$ (replacing each $2$ by $1$) gives a surjection onto $[0,1]$ via binary representations. Hence $|\mathcal{C}| = |\mathbb{R}|$.

### 3. Perfect Set

$\mathcal{C}$ is **perfect**: it is closed and every point is a limit point. There are no isolated points.

### 4. Nowhere Dense

$\mathcal{C}$ is **nowhere dense**: it contains no intervals. Its interior is empty.

### 5. Totally Disconnected

$\mathcal{C}$ is **totally disconnected**: the only connected subsets are singletons. Yet it is compact and uncountable — a remarkable combination.

## Self-Similarity and Fractal Dimension

The Cantor set is **self-similar**: it is the union of two scaled copies of itself:

$$
\mathcal{C} = \frac{1}{3}\mathcal{C} \cup \left(\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3}\mathcal{C}\right)
$$

Its **Hausdorff dimension** (fractal dimension) is:

$$
\dim_H(\mathcal{C}) = \frac{\log 2}{\log 3} \approx 0.6309
$$

This reflects the fact that $\mathcal{C}$ is "between" a finite set of points (dimension $0$) and a line segment (dimension $1$).

## The Cantor Function (Devil's Staircase)

The **Cantor function** $f: [0,1] \to [0,1]$ is defined by:
- On a removed interval at step $n$, $f$ takes the value $k/2^n$ for appropriate $k$.
- $f$ is extended to $\mathcal{C}$ by continuity.

This function is:
- **Continuous** and **monotonically non-decreasing**
- **Constant** on each removed interval (hence $f' = 0$ a.e.)
- Yet $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$

A continuous function whose derivative is zero almost everywhere, yet which increases from $0$ to $1$! This shows that a function can "increase without really increasing" — challenging our intuition about the fundamental theorem of calculus.

## Key Takeaways

1. The Cantor set shows that **measure** and **cardinality** are fundamentally different concepts.
2. It is the prototypical **fractal** — geometrically complex despite a simple construction rule.
3. It serves as a universal model: every compact metric space is a continuous image of $\mathcal{C}$.
4. The Cantor function demonstrates the subtlety of the relationship between differentiation and integration.
