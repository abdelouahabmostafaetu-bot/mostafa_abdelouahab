## Introduction

**Homological algebra** is the study of algebraic structures through chain complexes, exact sequences, and the functors that connect them. Developed in the mid-20th century by Cartan, Eilenberg, and Grothendieck, it provides universal tools that apply across topology, algebra, geometry, and number theory. As Grothendieck showed, even the most concrete mathematical problems often have their deepest explanations in homological terms.

## Chain Complexes

A **chain complex** $(C_\bullet, d)$ is a sequence of abelian groups (or modules) connected by **boundary maps**:

$$
\cdots \xrightarrow{d_{n+2}} C_{n+1} \xrightarrow{d_{n+1}} C_n \xrightarrow{d_n} C_{n-1} \xrightarrow{d_{n-1}} \cdots
$$

satisfying $d_n \circ d_{n+1} = 0$ for all $n$ — equivalently, $\text{im}(d_{n+1}) \subseteq \ker(d_n)$.

The **$n$-th homology** of the complex is:

$$
H_n(C_\bullet) = \frac{\ker(d_n: C_n \to C_{n-1})}{\text{im}(d_{n+1}: C_{n+1} \to C_n)} = \frac{Z_n}{B_n}
$$

where $Z_n$ = **cycles** (elements mapped to 0) and $B_n$ = **boundaries** (elements in the image of $d$).

Homology measures the "failure of exactness" — when $\text{im}(d_{n+1}) \neq \ker(d_n)$, something topologically or algebraically interesting is happening.

## Exact Sequences

A sequence $A \xrightarrow{f} B \xrightarrow{g} C$ is **exact at $B$** if $\text{im}(f) = \ker(g)$.

### Short Exact Sequences

A **short exact sequence** (SES) is:

$$
0 \to A \xrightarrow{f} B \xrightarrow{g} C \to 0
$$

This means: $f$ is injective, $g$ is surjective, and $\ker(g) = \text{im}(f)$. So $B$ is an "extension" of $C$ by $A$.

**Examples:**

$$
0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{\times 2} \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{\text{mod } 2} \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \to 0
$$

$$
0 \to \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \cong S^1 \to 0
$$

A SES **splits** if $B \cong A \oplus C$. This happens if and only if $g$ has a right inverse (section) or $f$ has a left inverse (retraction).

### The Snake Lemma

**Theorem (Snake Lemma).** Given a commutative diagram with exact rows:

$$
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
& & A & \to & B & \to & C & \to 0 \\
& & \downarrow^f & & \downarrow^g & & \downarrow^h \\
0 \to & & A' & \to & B' & \to & C' &
\end{array}
$$

there is a natural **connecting homomorphism** $\delta: \ker(h) \to \text{coker}(f)$ and an exact sequence:

$$
\ker(f) \to \ker(g) \to \ker(h) \xrightarrow{\delta} \text{coker}(f) \to \text{coker}(g) \to \text{coker}(h)
$$

The snake lemma is the workhorse of homological algebra — it "chases" elements through diagrams.

## Derived Functors

Many functors (like $\text{Hom}$ and $\otimes$) are exact on one side but not both. **Derived functors** measure the failure of exactness.

### Ext

For $R$-modules $A$ and $B$, take a projective resolution of $A$:

$$
\cdots \to P_2 \to P_1 \to P_0 \to A \to 0
$$

Apply $\text{Hom}(-, B)$ and take cohomology:

$$
\text{Ext}^n_R(A, B) = H^n(\text{Hom}(P_\bullet, B))
$$

**Properties:**
- $\text{Ext}^0(A, B) = \text{Hom}(A, B)$
- $\text{Ext}^1(A, B)$ classifies extensions of $A$ by $B$
- $\text{Ext}^n(A, B) = 0$ for all $n \geq 1$ iff $A$ is projective (or $B$ is injective)

**Example:** $\text{Ext}^1_\mathbb{Z}(\mathbb{Z}/n, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}/n$.

### Tor

For right $R$-module $A$ and left $R$-module $B$:

$$
\text{Tor}_n^R(A, B) = H_n(A \otimes_R P_\bullet)
$$

where $P_\bullet \to B \to 0$ is a projective resolution.

- $\text{Tor}_0(A, B) = A \otimes_R B$
- $\text{Tor}_n(A, B) = 0$ for all $n \geq 1$ iff $A$ or $B$ is flat

**Example:** $\text{Tor}_1^\mathbb{Z}(\mathbb{Z}/m, \mathbb{Z}/n) \cong \mathbb{Z}/\gcd(m,n)$.

## The Long Exact Sequence

**Theorem.** A short exact sequence of chain complexes $0 \to A_\bullet \to B_\bullet \to C_\bullet \to 0$ induces a **long exact sequence** in homology:

$$
\cdots \to H_n(A) \to H_n(B) \to H_n(C) \xrightarrow{\partial} H_{n-1}(A) \to H_{n-1}(B) \to \cdots
$$

The **connecting homomorphism** $\partial$ is constructed via diagram chasing (the snake lemma). This long exact sequence is perhaps the most important tool in algebraic topology.

## Spectral Sequences

A **spectral sequence** is a systematic way of computing homology through successive approximations:

$$
E_2^{p,q} \Rightarrow H^{p+q}
$$

Starting from the $E_2$ page, each page is the homology of the previous one: $E_{r+1} = H(E_r)$.

**Applications:**
- **Leray–Serre spectral sequence:** Computes homology of fiber bundles
- **Grothendieck spectral sequence:** Derives composite functors: $R(G \circ F) \cong RG \circ RF$
- **Lyndon–Hochschild–Serre:** Group cohomology of extensions

## Key Takeaways

1. **Chain complexes** and their homology measure algebraic "holes" and obstructions.
2. **Exact sequences** encode algebraic relationships; the snake lemma extracts information.
3. **Derived functors** ($\text{Ext}$, $\text{Tor}$) measure the failure of $\text{Hom}$ and $\otimes$ to be exact.
4. **Spectral sequences** compute homology through successive approximations.
