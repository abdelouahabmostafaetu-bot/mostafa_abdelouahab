## Introduction

Infinity is not a number — it is a **concept** that mathematicians have tamed through set theory. The results are counterintuitive, beautiful, and sometimes paradoxical.

## Hilbert's Hotel

Imagine a hotel with **infinitely many** rooms, all occupied. A new guest arrives:

- **One guest:** Move guest in room $n$ to room $n+1$. Room 1 is now free.
- **Countably many guests:** Move guest $n$ to room $2n$. All odd rooms are free.

This works because $|\mathbb{N}| = |\mathbb{N} \setminus \{1\}| = |2\mathbb{N}|$ — all countably infinite.

## Cantor's Diagonal Argument

**Theorem (Cantor, 1891).** The real numbers are **uncountable**: $|\mathbb{R}| > |\mathbb{N}|$.

*Proof.* Suppose $f: \mathbb{N} \to (0,1)$ is a surjection. Write each $f(n)$ in decimal:

$$
f(n) = 0.d_{n1}d_{n2}d_{n3}\ldots
$$

Define $x = 0.x_1x_2x_3\ldots$ where $x_n \neq d_{nn}$ (and $x_n \notin \{0, 9\}$). Then $x \neq f(n)$ for all $n$ (they differ in the $n$-th digit). Contradiction. $\square$

## Cardinals and Cardinalities

$$
|\mathbb{N}| = \aleph_0 < |\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\aleph_0} = \mathfrak{c}
$$

**Cantor's theorem:** For any set $A$, $|A| < |\mathcal{P}(A)|$. This gives an infinite hierarchy:

$$
\aleph_0 < 2^{\aleph_0} < 2^{2^{\aleph_0}} < \cdots
$$

## The Continuum Hypothesis

**CH:** There is no cardinal between $\aleph_0$ and $2^{\aleph_0}$, i.e., $2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_1$.

Gödel (1940) proved CH is consistent with ZFC. Cohen (1963) proved its negation is also consistent. CH is **independent** of ZFC.

## Key Takeaways

1. Not all infinities are equal: $|\mathbb{N}| < |\mathbb{R}|$.
2. The diagonal argument is one of the most powerful proof techniques in mathematics.
3. The Continuum Hypothesis is independent of standard set theory — it can neither be proved nor disproved from ZFC.
