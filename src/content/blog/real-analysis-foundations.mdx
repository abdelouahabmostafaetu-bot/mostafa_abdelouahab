## Introduction

**Real analysis** is calculus done right. Where calculus uses intuition and computation, real analysis demands proof and precision. It is the rigorous study of limits, continuity, differentiation, and integration on the real line — the bedrock upon which all of modern analysis is built.

## The Completeness of $\mathbb{R}$

The single most important property of $\mathbb{R}$ — distinguishing it from $\mathbb{Q}$ — is **completeness**.

**Axiom (Least Upper Bound Property).** Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a **supremum** (least upper bound) in $\mathbb{R}$.

This axiom is equivalent to several other fundamental properties:

1. **Monotone Convergence:** Every bounded monotone sequence converges.
2. **Nested Intervals:** If $[a_n, b_n]$ is a nested sequence of closed intervals, then $\bigcap [a_n, b_n] \neq \emptyset$.
3. **Bolzano–Weierstrass:** Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence.
4. **Cauchy completeness:** Every Cauchy sequence converges.

These equivalences are among the first important theorems in real analysis. Each captures a different aspect of "no gaps in $\mathbb{R}$."

## Sequences and Their Limits

A sequence $(a_n)$ **converges** to $L$ if:

$$
\forall \varepsilon > 0, \; \exists N \in \mathbb{N} : n \geq N \implies |a_n - L| < \varepsilon
$$

### Key Theorems on Sequences

**Squeeze Theorem.** If $a_n \leq b_n \leq c_n$ and $a_n, c_n \to L$, then $b_n \to L$.

**Cesàro Mean.** If $a_n \to L$, then $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n a_k \to L$.

**Stolz–Cesàro.** If $b_n$ is strictly increasing to $\infty$ and $\frac{a_{n+1}-a_n}{b_{n+1}-b_n} \to L$, then $\frac{a_n}{b_n} \to L$.

## Series

An infinite series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges if the sequence of partial sums $S_N = \sum_{n=1}^N a_n$ converges.

### Convergence Tests

**1. Comparison Test.** If $0 \leq a_n \leq b_n$ and $\sum b_n$ converges, then $\sum a_n$ converges.

**2. Ratio Test.** If $\lim \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = L$, then:
- $L < 1$: converges absolutely
- $L > 1$: diverges
- $L = 1$: inconclusive

**3. Root Test.** If $\limsup |a_n|^{1/n} = L$, same conclusions as the ratio test.

**4. Alternating Series Test (Leibniz).** If $a_n \geq 0$, $a_n \downarrow 0$, then $\sum (-1)^n a_n$ converges.

### Absolute vs. Conditional Convergence

A series is **absolutely convergent** if $\sum |a_n|$ converges. Absolute convergence implies convergence, but not conversely.

**Riemann's Rearrangement Theorem.** If $\sum a_n$ converges conditionally, then for any $L \in \mathbb{R} \cup \{\pm\infty\}$, there exists a rearrangement of the series that converges to $L$.

This stunning result shows that the order of summation matters for conditionally convergent series.

## Continuity

A function $f: D \to \mathbb{R}$ is **continuous** at $c \in D$ if:

$$
\forall \varepsilon > 0, \; \exists \delta > 0 : |x - c| < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(c)| < \varepsilon
$$

### The Extreme Value Theorem

**Theorem.** A continuous function on a closed bounded interval $[a,b]$ attains its maximum and minimum.

### The Intermediate Value Theorem

**Theorem.** If $f: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous and $f(a) < c < f(b)$, then there exists $x \in (a,b)$ with $f(x) = c$.

This theorem is a consequence of the **connectedness** of $[a,b]$ and seems obvious, but it requires completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ — it fails in $\mathbb{Q}$.

## Uniform Continuity

$f$ is **uniformly continuous** on $D$ if $\delta$ can be chosen independently of the point:

$$
\forall \varepsilon > 0, \; \exists \delta > 0 : |x - y| < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(y)| < \varepsilon \quad \forall x, y \in D
$$

**Heine's Theorem.** A continuous function on a compact set is uniformly continuous.

The function $f(x) = 1/x$ on $(0,1)$ is continuous but not uniformly continuous — an important distinction.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Completeness** is the fundamental property that separates $\mathbb{R}$ from $\mathbb{Q}$ and makes analysis possible.
2. The **$\varepsilon$-$\delta$ definition** of limits and continuity gives calculus its rigorous foundation.
3. **Series convergence** is a subtle topic — absolute convergence is robust, conditional convergence is fragile.
4. Theorems like IVT and EVT seem obvious but **require** completeness — they are deep results.
