## Introduction

Every real number has a **continued fraction** expansion:

$$
\alpha = a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + \cdots}}}
$$

Written compactly as $\alpha = [a_0; a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots]$. This representation reveals deep arithmetic structure that decimal expansions hide.

## Computing the Expansion

For $\alpha = \sqrt{2}$:

$a_0 = \lfloor \sqrt{2} \rfloor = 1$, then $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}-1} = \sqrt{2}+1$, so $a_1 = 2$, and the pattern repeats:

$$
\sqrt{2} = [1; 2, 2, 2, 2, \ldots] = [1; \overline{2}]
$$

## Convergents and Best Approximations

The **convergents** $p_n/q_n = [a_0; a_1, \ldots, a_n]$ satisfy the recurrence:

$$
p_n = a_n p_{n-1} + p_{n-2}, \qquad q_n = a_n q_{n-1} + q_{n-2}
$$

**Theorem.** Convergents are the **best rational approximations**: if $|\alpha - p/q| < |\alpha - p_n/q_n|$ with $q \leq q_n$, then $q > q_{n-1}$.

## Lagrange's Theorem

A real number $\alpha$ has a **periodic** continued fraction if and only if $\alpha$ is a **quadratic irrational** (root of a quadratic with integer coefficients).

Example: $\varphi = [1; \overline{1}]$, $\sqrt{3} = [1; \overline{1, 2}]$, $\sqrt{7} = [2; \overline{1, 1, 1, 4}]$.

## Key Takeaways

1. Continued fractions give the best rational approximations to irrational numbers.
2. Periodic continued fractions characterize quadratic irrationals (Lagrange's theorem).
3. The golden ratio $\varphi = [1; 1, 1, \ldots]$ has the slowest-converging continued fraction.
