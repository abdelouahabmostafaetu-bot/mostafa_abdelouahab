## Introduction

The **AM-GM inequality** states: for non-negative reals $a_1, \ldots, a_n$:

$$
\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n}
$$

with equality iff $a_1 = a_2 = \cdots = a_n$.

## Power Mean Generalization

For $r \in \mathbb{R}$, the **power mean** of order $r$ is:

$$
M_r = \left(\frac{a_1^r + \cdots + a_n^r}{n}\right)^{1/r}
$$

**Power Mean Inequality:** If $r < s$, then $M_r \leq M_s$, with:

$$
\min \leq M_{-\infty} \leq M_{-1} \leq M_0 \leq M_1 \leq M_2 \leq M_{\infty} \leq \max
$$

where $M_0 = \text{GM}$, $M_1 = \text{AM}$, $M_{-1} = \text{HM}$, $M_2 = \text{QM}$.

## Applications

**Optimization:** Minimize $f(x) = x + \frac{1}{x}$ for $x > 0$:

$$
x + \frac{1}{x} \geq 2\sqrt{x \cdot \frac{1}{x}} = 2
$$

Equality at $x = 1$.

**Proving inequalities:** For $a + b + c = 3$ with $a, b, c > 0$:

$$
a^2b^2c^2 \leq \left(\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{3}\right)^3 \leq \left(\frac{a + b + c}{3}\right)^6 = 1
$$

So $abc \leq 1$.

## Weighted AM-GM

With weights $w_i > 0$ summing to $1$:

$$
w_1 a_1 + \cdots + w_n a_n \geq a_1^{w_1} \cdots a_n^{w_n}
$$

This follows from the concavity of $\log$.

## Key Takeaways

1. AM-GM is the go-to inequality for optimization with products.
2. The power mean hierarchy $\text{HM} \leq \text{GM} \leq \text{AM} \leq \text{QM}$ unifies many inequalities.
3. Weighted AM-GM follows from concavity of logarithm (Jensen's inequality).
