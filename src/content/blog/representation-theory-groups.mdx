## Introduction

**Representation theory** converts abstract algebra into concrete linear algebra. Rather than studying a group $G$ as an abstract algebraic object, we study it through its **representations** — homomorphisms $G \to GL(V)$ that let $G$ act on vector spaces. This approach not only makes groups more tangible but reveals hidden structure and has applications from quantum mechanics to number theory.

## Definitions

A **(linear) representation** of a group $G$ on a vector space $V$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is a group homomorphism:

$$
\rho: G \to GL(V)
$$

Equivalently, $V$ is a **$G$-module**: a vector space with a $G$-action compatible with the linear structure.

The **dimension** (or degree) of the representation is $\dim V$.

### Examples

**1. Trivial representation:** $\rho(g) = I$ for all $g$, on any $V$.

**2. Regular representation:** $G$ acts on $\mathbb{C}[G] = \bigoplus_{g \in G} \mathbb{C} \cdot e_g$ by left multiplication.

**3.** $S_n$ acts on $\mathbb{C}^n$ by permuting coordinates: $\rho(\sigma)(e_i) = e_{\sigma(i)}$.

**4.** $D_n$ (dihedral group) acts on $\mathbb{R}^2$ by rotations and reflections.

**5.** The groups $SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$ have representations on spaces of spherical harmonics — these are the angular momentum representations of quantum mechanics.

## Subrepresentations and Irreducibility

A **subrepresentation** is a subspace $W \subseteq V$ that is $G$-invariant: $\rho(g)(W) \subseteq W$ for all $g$.

A representation is **irreducible** (or simple) if its only subrepresentations are $\{0\}$ and $V$.

Irreducible representations are the "atoms" of representation theory — the building blocks from which all representations are constructed.

## Maschke's Theorem

**Theorem (Maschke).** Let $G$ be a finite group and $\text{char}(\mathbb{C}) \nmid |G|$ (automatic over $\mathbb{C}$). Every representation of $G$ is **completely reducible**: it decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations.

$$
V \cong V_1^{\oplus n_1} \oplus V_2^{\oplus n_2} \oplus \cdots \oplus V_k^{\oplus n_k}
$$

where $V_1, \ldots, V_k$ are the distinct irreducibles in $V$.

**Proof idea.** Given a $G$-invariant subspace $W \subseteq V$, construct a $G$-invariant complement by averaging any projection $\pi: V \to W$ over the group:

$$
\hat{\pi}(v) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) \circ \pi \circ \rho(g)^{-1}(v)
$$

Then $\ker(\hat{\pi})$ is a $G$-invariant complement to $W$.

## Schur's Lemma

**Theorem (Schur).** Let $V, W$ be irreducible representations of $G$.

1. If $\phi: V \to W$ is a $G$-equivariant map, then $\phi = 0$ or $\phi$ is an isomorphism.
2. If $V = W$ (over $\mathbb{C}$), then $\phi = \lambda \cdot I$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$.

**Consequence:** Over $\mathbb{C}$, $\text{Hom}_G(V_i, V_j) \cong \begin{cases} \mathbb{C} & i = j \\ 0 & i \neq j \end{cases}$

## Characters

The **character** of a representation $\rho$ is the function $\chi: G \to \mathbb{C}$ defined by:

$$
\chi(g) = \text{tr}(\rho(g))
$$

Characters are **class functions** — they are constant on conjugacy classes.

### Orthogonality Relations

For irreducible characters $\chi_i, \chi_j$ of a finite group $G$:

$$
\langle \chi_i, \chi_j \rangle = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} \chi_i(g)\overline{\chi_j(g)} = \delta_{ij}
$$

The irreducible characters form an **orthonormal basis** for the space of class functions.

### The Character Table

A finite group $G$ has exactly $k$ irreducible representations (up to isomorphism), where $k$ equals the number of conjugacy classes. The **character table** is a $k \times k$ matrix recording $\chi_i(C_j)$.

**Fundamental fact:**

$$
\sum_{i=1}^k (\dim V_i)^2 = |G|
$$

**Example ($S_3$):** $|S_3| = 6$, three conjugacy classes, three irreducible representations of dimensions 1, 1, 2 (since $1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 6$).

## The Regular Representation

The regular representation $\mathbb{C}[G]$ decomposes as:

$$
\mathbb{C}[G] \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^k V_i^{\oplus \dim V_i}
$$

Each irreducible representation $V_i$ appears with multiplicity equal to its dimension. This is a deep structural result: the group algebra "contains" every representation.

## Applications

### Quantum Mechanics

The symmetries of a quantum system form a group $G$, and the Hilbert space decomposes into irreducible representations. Selection rules, spectral degeneracies, and conservation laws all follow from representation theory.

### Number Theory

**Artin $L$-functions** are defined from representations of Galois groups:

$$
L(s, \rho) = \prod_p \det(I - \rho(\text{Frob}_p)p^{-s})^{-1}
$$

The **Langlands program** seeks to connect these to automorphic representations.

### Chemistry

Molecular symmetry groups determine which vibrational modes are IR-active or Raman-active, via irreducible representations.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Representations** make abstract groups concrete by letting them act on vector spaces.
2. **Maschke's theorem** guarantees complete reducibility for finite groups over $\mathbb{C}$.
3. **Characters** are the computational tool: orthogonality relations determine decompositions.
4. Representation theory connects to **physics**, **number theory**, and **chemistry**.
