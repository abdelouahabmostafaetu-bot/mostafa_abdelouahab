## Introduction

The **harmonic series** $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$ diverges. Yet its partial sums grow so slowly that after $10^{43}$ terms, the sum barely exceeds $100$. This leisurely divergence hides deep mathematics.

## Proof of Divergence

**Oresme's proof (c. 1350):**

$$
1 + \frac{1}{2} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}}_{> 1/2} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{5} + \cdots + \frac{1}{8}}_{> 1/2} + \cdots > 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \cdots = \infty
$$

## The Euler-Mascheroni Constant

The partial sums satisfy:

$$
H_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = \ln n + \gamma + \frac{1}{2n} - \frac{1}{12n^2} + O(n^{-4})
$$

where $\gamma = \lim_{n \to \infty} (H_n - \ln n) \approx 0.5772$ is the **Euler-Mascheroni constant**. Whether $\gamma$ is rational or irrational is still unknown!

## Alternating Harmonic Series

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \cdots = \ln 2
$$

But by the **Riemann rearrangement theorem**, the terms can be rearranged to converge to **any** real number — a stunning consequence of conditional convergence.

## The Prime Harmonic Series

$$
\sum_{p \text{ prime}} \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{11} + \cdots = \infty
$$

The divergence of this series is a deep result — proved by Euler — confirming that primes are "not too sparse."

## Key Takeaways

1. The harmonic series diverges at the rate $H_n \sim \ln n$.
2. The Euler-Mascheroni constant $\gamma \approx 0.5772$ is one of the most mysterious constants.
3. Conditional convergence allows rearrangement to any sum (Riemann's theorem).
