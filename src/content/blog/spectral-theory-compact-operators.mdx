## Introduction

The **spectral theory of compact operators** extends the familiar eigenvalue theory of matrices to infinite-dimensional spaces. Compact operators — those that map bounded sets to relatively compact sets — behave remarkably like matrices: their nonzero spectrum consists entirely of eigenvalues, each of finite multiplicity, accumulating only at zero. This theory, developed by Fredholm, Riesz, and Hilbert, is the foundation for solving integral equations and understanding infinite-dimensional linear algebra.

## Compact Operators

A bounded linear operator $T: X \to Y$ between Banach spaces is **compact** if $T(B_X)$ is relatively compact in $Y$ (its closure is compact).

**Equivalent formulations** (in Banach spaces):
1. Every bounded sequence $(x_n)$ has a subsequence such that $(Tx_{n_k})$ converges
2. $T$ is the norm limit of finite-rank operators (in Hilbert spaces; in general Banach spaces, this is the **approximation property**)

### Examples

**1. Finite-rank operators:** $T(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \langle x, e_i \rangle f_i$ — always compact.

**2. Integral operators with continuous kernels:** On $L^2([0,1])$:

$$
(Tf)(x) = \int_0^1 K(x, y) f(y) \, dy
$$

If $K \in C([0,1]^2)$, then $T$ is compact (by the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem).

**3. The inclusion** $\ell^1 \hookrightarrow \ell^2$ is compact.

**4.** The **Hilbert–Schmidt operators**: $\sum_{i,j} |a_{ij}|^2 < \infty$.

### Properties of Compact Operators

- The compact operators form a **closed two-sided ideal** in $\mathcal{L}(X)$.
- Sum and scalar multiple of compact operators are compact.
- $T$ compact, $S$ bounded $\Rightarrow$ $TS$ and $ST$ compact.
- **Riesz's theorem:** The identity $I: X \to X$ is compact $\iff$ $\dim X < \infty$.

## Spectral Theory

### The Spectrum

For $T \in \mathcal{L}(X)$, the **spectrum** $\sigma(T) = \{\lambda \in \mathbb{C} : T - \lambda I \text{ is not invertible}\}$.

The spectrum decomposes as:
- **Point spectrum** $\sigma_p(T)$: eigenvalues ($T - \lambda I$ not injective)
- **Continuous spectrum** $\sigma_c(T)$: $T - \lambda I$ injective with dense but not full range
- **Residual spectrum** $\sigma_r(T)$: $T - \lambda I$ injective with non-dense range

### The Riesz–Schauder Theorem

**Theorem.** Let $T: X \to X$ be a compact operator on a Banach space. Then:

1. $\sigma(T) \setminus \{0\}$ consists entirely of **eigenvalues**
2. Each nonzero eigenvalue has **finite multiplicity** (geometric and algebraic)
3. $\sigma(T) \setminus \{0\}$ is **at most countable** with no limit point except possibly $0$
4. If $\dim X = \infty$, then $0 \in \sigma(T)$

**In summary:** A compact operator on an infinite-dimensional space has spectrum that looks like the spectrum of a matrix, plus 0.

## The Fredholm Alternative

**Theorem (Fredholm Alternative).** Let $T$ be a compact operator on a Banach space $X$ and $\lambda \neq 0$. Then exactly one of the following holds:

**(A)** $T - \lambda I$ is bijective: the equation $(T - \lambda I)x = y$ has a unique solution for every $y$.

**(B)** $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$: $(T - \lambda I)x = 0$ has nontrivial solutions, and $(T - \lambda I)x = y$ is solvable if and only if $y$ is orthogonal to the eigenspace of $T^* - \bar{\lambda}I$.

There is no middle ground — like finite-dimensional linear algebra, it's either uniquely solvable or the kernel is nontrivial.

### Application: Integral Equations

Consider the **Fredholm integral equation of the second kind**:

$$
f(x) - \lambda \int_0^1 K(x,y) f(y) \, dy = g(x)
$$

The Fredholm alternative gives: either this has a unique solution for every $g$, or the associated homogeneous equation has nontrivial solutions and solvability depends on $g$.

## The Spectral Theorem for Compact Self-Adjoint Operators

**Theorem.** Let $T: H \to H$ be a compact self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space. Then:

1. All eigenvalues are **real**
2. Eigenvectors for distinct eigenvalues are **orthogonal**
3. $H$ has an **orthonormal basis** of eigenvectors of $T$
4. $Tx = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \lambda_n \langle x, e_n \rangle e_n$ where $\lambda_n \to 0$

This is the infinite-dimensional generalization of the diagonalization theorem for symmetric matrices: **every compact self-adjoint operator is "diagonalizable."**

### Min-Max Characterization

The eigenvalues satisfy the **Courant–Fischer min-max principle**:

$$
\lambda_n = \min_{\dim V = n-1} \max_{\substack{x \perp V \\ \|x\| = 1}} \langle Tx, x \rangle
$$

## Trace Class and Hilbert–Schmidt Operators

For compact $T$ on a Hilbert space with singular values $s_1 \geq s_2 \geq \cdots$:

- $T$ is **trace class** if $\sum s_n < \infty$; then $\text{tr}(T) = \sum \lambda_n$.
- $T$ is **Hilbert–Schmidt** if $\sum s_n^2 < \infty$; equivalently $\sum_{i,j} |\langle Te_i, e_j \rangle|^2 < \infty$.

The integral operator with kernel $K \in L^2([0,1]^2)$ is Hilbert–Schmidt with:

$$
\|T\|_{HS}^2 = \int_0^1\int_0^1 |K(x,y)|^2 \, dx\,dy
$$

## Key Takeaways

1. Compact operators have **matrix-like spectra**: countable eigenvalues accumulating only at 0.
2. The **Fredholm alternative** gives a clean dichotomy: unique solvability or kernel nontriviality.
3. The **spectral theorem** diagonalizes compact self-adjoint operators — the foundation of quantum mechanics.
4. These results enable the solution of **integral equations** and the analysis of infinite-dimensional operators.
