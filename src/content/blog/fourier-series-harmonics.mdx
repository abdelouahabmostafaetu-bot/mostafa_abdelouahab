## Introduction

The idea that a function can be expressed as an infinite sum of sines and cosines is one of the most powerful ideas in all of mathematics. Introduced by **Joseph Fourier** in 1807 in his study of heat conduction, Fourier series have become indispensable in analysis, physics, engineering, and signal processing.

## Definition

Let $f: [-\pi, \pi] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a periodic function with period $2\pi$. Its **Fourier series** is:

$$
f(x) \sim \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(a_n \cos(nx) + b_n \sin(nx)\right)
$$

where the **Fourier coefficients** are:

$$
a_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \cos(nx) \, dx, \quad b_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) \sin(nx) \, dx
$$

### Complex Form

Using Euler's formula, we can write:

$$
f(x) \sim \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} c_n e^{inx}, \quad c_n = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) e^{-inx} \, dx
$$

## The Inner Product Perspective

The functions $\{1, \cos(nx), \sin(nx)\}_{n \geq 1}$ form an **orthogonal system** in $L^2([-\pi, \pi])$ with the inner product:

$$
\langle f, g \rangle = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) g(x) \, dx
$$

The Fourier coefficients are simply the **projections** of $f$ onto these basis functions:

$$
a_n = \frac{\langle f, \cos(nx) \rangle}{\langle \cos(nx), \cos(nx) \rangle}
$$

This reveals Fourier analysis as a special case of **Hilbert space theory**.

## Convergence Theorems

### Parseval's Theorem

For $f \in L^2([-\pi, \pi])$:

$$
\frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} |f(x)|^2 \, dx = \frac{a_0^2}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (a_n^2 + b_n^2)
$$

This says the energy of the function equals the sum of the energies of its harmonics.

### Pointwise Convergence (Dirichlet Conditions)

If $f$ is piecewise smooth, then:

$$
\frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (a_n \cos(nx) + b_n \sin(nx)) = \frac{f(x^+) + f(x^-)}{2}
$$

At points of continuity, the series converges to $f(x)$. At jumps, it converges to the average of left and right limits.

### $L^2$ Convergence

The Fourier series of any $f \in L^2$ converges in $L^2$-norm. The system $\{e^{inx}\}$ is a **complete orthonormal system** in $L^2$.

## Classical Example: The Square Wave

Let $f(x) = \text{sgn}(x)$ on $(-\pi, \pi)$. Its Fourier series is:

$$
f(x) = \frac{4}{\pi} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\sin((2k+1)x)}{2k+1}
$$

Setting $x = \pi/2$:

$$
1 = \frac{4}{\pi}\left(1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \cdots\right) \implies \frac{\pi}{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \cdots
$$

This is the **Leibniz formula** for $\pi$ — a beautiful connection between Fourier analysis and number theory.

## The Gibbs Phenomenon

At a jump discontinuity, the partial sums of the Fourier series **overshoot** by approximately $9\%$ of the jump. This overshoot does not diminish as more terms are added — it merely becomes narrower. This is the **Gibbs phenomenon**, discovered in 1899.

## Application: Solving the Heat Equation

Fourier's original motivation was the **heat equation**:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

The solution is obtained by expanding the initial condition $u(x, 0)$ in a Fourier series:

$$
u(x, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n e^{-\alpha n^2 t} \sin(nx)
$$

Each harmonic decays exponentially at a rate proportional to $n^2$, so high-frequency components vanish quickly — explaining why heat distributions smooth out over time.

## Key Takeaways

1. The Fourier series decomposes a function into its **frequency components**.
2. **Parseval's theorem** provides the connection between the function and its coefficients.
3. The convergence theory is subtle: pointwise, $L^2$, and uniform convergence each have different conditions.
4. Fourier analysis is the bridge between **analysis** and **applied mathematics**.
