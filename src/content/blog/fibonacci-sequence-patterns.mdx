## Introduction

The **Fibonacci sequence** $0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \ldots$ defined by $F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n$ with $F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1$ is one of the most studied sequences in mathematics. Its patterns extend far beyond simple recursion.

## Matrix Form

The Fibonacci recursion can be encoded as a matrix power:

$$
\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} \\ F_n \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}^n \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
$$

This immediately gives the identity $F_{n+1}F_{n-1} - F_n^2 = (-1)^n$ (Cassini's identity) by taking determinants.

## Generating Function

The ordinary generating function is:

$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} F_n x^n = \frac{x}{1 - x - x^2}
$$

## Remarkable Identities

**Sum of first $n$ Fibonacci numbers:**
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} F_k = F_{n+2} - 1
$$

**Sum of squares:**
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} F_k^2 = F_n F_{n+1}
$$

**GCD property:** $\gcd(F_m, F_n) = F_{\gcd(m,n)}$

**Divisibility:** $F_m \mid F_{mn}$ for all positive integers $m, n$.

## Zeckendorf's Theorem

Every positive integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers. For example: $20 = 13 + 5 + 2$.

## Key Takeaways

1. The matrix form gives a fast $O(\log n)$ algorithm for computing $F_n$.
2. The GCD property $\gcd(F_m, F_n) = F_{\gcd(m,n)}$ is a beautiful number-theoretic result.
3. Zeckendorf representation is the Fibonacci analogue of binary representation.
