## Introduction

**Algebraic topology** uses algebraic structures — groups, rings, modules — to study topological spaces. The core idea: assign algebraic invariants to spaces so that topologically equivalent spaces have isomorphic invariants. The simplest and most intuitive such invariant is the **fundamental group**.

## Homotopy of Paths

Let $X$ be a topological space and $x_0 \in X$ a basepoint. A **loop** at $x_0$ is a continuous map $\gamma: [0,1] \to X$ with $\gamma(0) = \gamma(1) = x_0$.

Two loops $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ are **homotopic** (written $\gamma_0 \simeq \gamma_1$) if there exists a continuous map $H: [0,1] \times [0,1] \to X$ such that:

$$
H(t, 0) = \gamma_0(t), \quad H(t, 1) = \gamma_1(t), \quad H(0, s) = H(1, s) = x_0
$$

Intuitively, we can continuously deform $\gamma_0$ into $\gamma_1$ while keeping the basepoint fixed.

Homotopy is an **equivalence relation**. The equivalence class $[\gamma]$ represents a "type" of loop.

## The Fundamental Group

The **fundamental group** $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is the set of homotopy classes of loops at $x_0$, equipped with the **concatenation** product:

$$
[\gamma] \cdot [\delta] = [\gamma * \delta]
$$

where $(\gamma * \delta)(t) = \begin{cases} \gamma(2t) & 0 \leq t \leq 1/2 \\ \delta(2t-1) & 1/2 \leq t \leq 1 \end{cases}$

**Theorem.** $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is a group with:
- **Identity:** the constant loop $[e_{x_0}]$
- **Inverse:** $[\gamma]^{-1} = [\bar{\gamma}]$ where $\bar{\gamma}(t) = \gamma(1-t)$

## Computations

### The Circle $S^1$

$$
\pi_1(S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z}
$$

The integer $n$ corresponds to a loop that winds $n$ times around the circle. This is proved using the theory of **covering spaces**: the universal cover of $S^1$ is $\mathbb{R}$ via $p(t) = e^{2\pi i t}$.

### Simply Connected Spaces

A space is **simply connected** if $\pi_1(X) = 0$ (trivial). Examples:
- $\mathbb{R}^n$ for all $n$
- $S^n$ for $n \geq 2$
- Any convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$

### The Torus $T^2 = S^1 \times S^1$

$$
\pi_1(T^2) \cong \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}
$$

generated by the two fundamental loops (one around each "hole").

### The Figure Eight $S^1 \vee S^1$

$$
\pi_1(S^1 \vee S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z} * \mathbb{Z}
$$

the **free group** on two generators — a non-abelian group! This is computed via the **van Kampen theorem**.

## The Van Kampen Theorem

**Theorem (Seifert–van Kampen).** If $X = U_1 \cup U_2$ where $U_1, U_2$ are open, path-connected, and $U_1 \cap U_2$ is path-connected, then:

$$
\pi_1(X) \cong \pi_1(U_1) *_{\pi_1(U_1 \cap U_2)} \pi_1(U_2)
$$

the **amalgamated free product**. This is the main computational tool for fundamental groups.

## Application: The Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem

**Theorem.** Every continuous map $f: D^2 \to D^2$ from the closed disk to itself has a fixed point.

**Proof.** Suppose $f$ has no fixed point. Then we can define a retraction $r: D^2 \to S^1$ by drawing a ray from $f(x)$ through $x$ to the boundary. This $r$ is continuous and satisfies $r|_{S^1} = \text{id}$.

But then the inclusion $i: S^1 \hookrightarrow D^2$ and $r$ give:

$$
\pi_1(S^1) \xrightarrow{i_*} \pi_1(D^2) \xrightarrow{r_*} \pi_1(S^1)
$$

with $r_* \circ i_* = \text{id}$. But $\pi_1(S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ and $\pi_1(D^2) = 0$, so $\text{id}: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ factors through $0$ — a contradiction. $\blacksquare$

## Key Takeaways

1. The **fundamental group** captures the "loop structure" of a space — which loops can be contracted to a point.
2. $\pi_1$ is a **topological invariant**: homeomorphic spaces have isomorphic fundamental groups.
3. The **van Kampen theorem** allows computation of $\pi_1$ for spaces built from simpler pieces.
4. Algebraic topology produces **non-existence results** (like the Brouwer theorem) that are difficult or impossible to prove by other means.
