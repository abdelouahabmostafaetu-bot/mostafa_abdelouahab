## Introduction

In dynamical systems, we often encounter systems that look different algebraically but behave identically from a qualitative perspective. **Topological conjugacy** provides the precise notion of equivalence: two systems are conjugate if there exists a homeomorphism that maps orbits of one system to orbits of the other.

## Definition

Two maps $f: X \to X$ and $g: Y \to Y$ are **topologically conjugate** if there exists a homeomorphism $h: X \to Y$ such that:

$$
h \circ f = g \circ h
$$

That is, the following diagram commutes:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
X & \xrightarrow{f} & X \\
\downarrow h & & \downarrow h \\
Y & \xrightarrow{g} & Y
\end{array}
$$

If $h$ is continuous but not necessarily a homeomorphism, we say $f$ and $g$ are **semi-conjugate** ($f$ is a factor of $g$).

## Why Conjugacy Matters

If $f$ and $g$ are conjugate:

1. **Fixed points correspond:** $f(x^*) = x^*$ $\iff$ $g(h(x^*)) = h(x^*)$
2. **Periodic orbits correspond:** $f^n(x) = x$ $\iff$ $g^n(h(x)) = h(x)$
3. **Stability is preserved:** $x^*$ is a stable fixed point of $f$ $\iff$ $h(x^*)$ is stable for $g$
4. **Chaos is preserved:** $f$ is chaotic $\iff$ $g$ is chaotic
5. **Topological entropy is preserved:** $h_{\text{top}}(f) = h_{\text{top}}(g)$

Conjugacy tells us that the systems have the **same qualitative dynamics** — they differ only in coordinates.

## Classical Example: The Logistic Map and the Tent Map

The **logistic map** $L(x) = 4x(1-x)$ on $[0,1]$ is conjugate to the **tent map**:

$$
T(x) = \begin{cases} 2x & 0 \leq x \leq 1/2 \\ 2(1-x) & 1/2 < x \leq 1 \end{cases}
$$

**The conjugacy** is given by $h(x) = \frac{2}{\pi}\arcsin(\sqrt{x})$, which satisfies:

$$
h \circ L = T \circ h
$$

This is remarkable: the logistic map, defined by a smooth polynomial, has exactly the same dynamics as the piecewise-linear tent map.

## Another Example: Doubling Map and Shift

The **doubling map** $D(x) = 2x \pmod{1}$ on $[0,1)$ is conjugate to the **left shift** on $\{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$ (sequences of $0$s and $1$s) via the binary expansion:

$$
h(x) = (a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots) \quad \text{where } x = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{a_k}{2^k}
$$

The shift $\sigma(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots) = (a_2, a_3, a_4, \ldots)$ satisfies $h \circ D = \sigma \circ h$.

This conjugacy makes it transparent that the doubling map:
- Has $2^n$ periodic orbits of period $n$ (corresponding to repeating binary strings)
- Has dense orbits (corresponding to sequences containing all finite binary strings)
- Is chaotic

## The Hartman–Grobman Theorem

The most important conjugacy result for flows:

**Theorem.** Let $\dot{x} = f(x)$ have a **hyperbolic** equilibrium at $x^*$ (all eigenvalues of $Df(x^*)$ have nonzero real part). Then the flow near $x^*$ is topologically conjugate to the linear flow $\dot{y} = Df(x^*) y$.

This theorem justifies **linearization**: near a hyperbolic fixed point, the nonlinear system behaves qualitatively like its linearization.

### Limitations

The theorem is **topological**, not smooth: the conjugacy $h$ is a homeomorphism but in general is **not differentiable**. For smooth conjugacy, we need the stronger **Sternberg linearization theorem**, which requires non-resonance conditions on the eigenvalues.

## Structural Stability

A system is **structurally stable** if every $C^1$-small perturbation is topologically conjugate to the original system. Structurally stable systems are "robust" — their qualitative behavior doesn't change under small perturbations.

**Theorem (Andronov–Pontryagin).** A $C^1$ flow on a compact 2-manifold is structurally stable if and only if:
1. All equilibria are hyperbolic.
2. All periodic orbits are hyperbolic.
3. There are no saddle connections.

## Invariants of Conjugacy

To prove two systems are **not** conjugate, we look for **conjugacy invariants** — properties preserved by conjugacy:

| Invariant | Description |
|---|---|
| Number of fixed points | $\#\text{Fix}(f)$ |
| Number of period-$n$ orbits | $\#\text{Per}_n(f)$ |
| Topological entropy | $h_{\text{top}}(f)$ |
| Zeta function | $\zeta_f(z) = \exp\sum \frac{z^n}{n}\#\text{Fix}(f^n)$ |
| Lyapunov exponents | Growth rates of perturbations |

If any invariant differs, the systems are not conjugate.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Topological conjugacy** is the correct notion of equivalence for dynamical systems.
2. Conjugate systems share all **qualitative dynamical properties** — fixed points, periodic orbits, stability, chaos.
3. The **Hartman–Grobman theorem** justifies linearization near hyperbolic equilibria.
4. **Conjugacy invariants** provide computable tools for distinguishing non-conjugate systems.
