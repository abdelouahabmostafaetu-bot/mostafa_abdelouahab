## Introduction

The **calculus of variations** addresses a fundamental question: among all curves, surfaces, or functions satisfying certain constraints, which one optimizes (minimizes or maximizes) a given **functional**? This question is as old as mathematics itself — the shortest path, the curve of fastest descent, the shape of minimal surface — and its answer leads to some of the most beautiful mathematics in analysis and physics.

## Functionals

A **functional** is a map from a space of functions to $\mathbb{R}$. The typical form is:

$$
J[y] = \int_a^b L(x, y(x), y'(x)) \, dx
$$

where $L$ is the **Lagrangian** and $y$ ranges over some admissible class of functions (e.g., $C^2[a,b]$ with fixed boundary conditions $y(a) = A$, $y(b) = B$).

**Examples:**

**1. Arc length:**
$$
J[y] = \int_a^b \sqrt{1 + (y')^2} \, dx
$$

**2. Surface area of revolution:**
$$
J[y] = 2\pi \int_a^b y\sqrt{1 + (y')^2} \, dx
$$

**3. Action in classical mechanics:**
$$
S[q] = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q, \dot{q}, t) \, dt = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} (T - V) \, dt
$$

## The Euler–Lagrange Equation

**Theorem.** If $y^*$ minimizes (or is a stationary point of) $J[y] = \int_a^b L(x, y, y')\,dx$ among functions with fixed endpoints $y(a) = A$, $y(b) = B$, then $y^*$ satisfies the **Euler–Lagrange equation**:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} - \frac{d}{dx}\frac{\partial L}{\partial y'} = 0
$$

### Proof Sketch

Consider a variation $y_\varepsilon = y^* + \varepsilon \eta$, where $\eta(a) = \eta(b) = 0$. Then $J[y_\varepsilon]$ must have a critical point at $\varepsilon = 0$:

$$
0 = \frac{d}{d\varepsilon}\bigg|_{\varepsilon=0} J[y_\varepsilon] = \int_a^b \left[\frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\eta + \frac{\partial L}{\partial y'}\eta'\right] dx
$$

Integration by parts on the second term (using $\eta(a) = \eta(b) = 0$):

$$
0 = \int_a^b \left[\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} - \frac{d}{dx}\frac{\partial L}{\partial y'}\right] \eta \, dx
$$

By the **fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations**, since this holds for all $\eta$, the bracket must vanish identically.

## Classical Problems

### The Brachistochrone

**Problem (Johann Bernoulli, 1696).** Find the curve of fastest descent under gravity from point $A$ to point $B$.

The functional is the descent time:

$$
T[y] = \int_0^{x_1} \frac{\sqrt{1 + (y')^2}}{\sqrt{2gy}} \, dx
$$

The Euler–Lagrange equation yields the **cycloid**:

$$
x(\theta) = \frac{a}{2}(\theta - \sin\theta), \quad y(\theta) = \frac{a}{2}(1 - \cos\theta)
$$

The curve of fastest descent is the path traced by a point on a rolling circle — a stunning result that surprised Bernoulli and catalyzed the development of the calculus of variations.

### Geodesics

On a surface with metric $ds^2 = g_{ij} \, dx^i \, dx^j$, the shortest path (geodesic) minimizes:

$$
L[\gamma] = \int_a^b \sqrt{g_{ij}\dot{\gamma}^i\dot{\gamma}^j} \, dt
$$

The Euler–Lagrange equations give the **geodesic equation**:

$$
\ddot{\gamma}^k + \Gamma^k_{ij}\dot{\gamma}^i\dot{\gamma}^j = 0
$$

where $\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are the **Christoffel symbols** — the bridge to differential geometry and general relativity.

### Minimal Surfaces

A **minimal surface** is a surface of zero mean curvature that minimizes area locally. The Euler–Lagrange equation for the area functional gives:

$$
(1 + u_y^2)u_{xx} - 2u_x u_y u_{xy} + (1 + u_x^2)u_{yy} = 0
$$

the **minimal surface equation** — a nonlinear elliptic PDE.

## Lagrangian Mechanics

In physics, the **principle of least action** states that a physical system evolves along the path that makes the **action** stationary:

$$
\delta S = \delta \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q, \dot{q}, t) \, dt = 0
$$

The Euler–Lagrange equations become **Lagrange's equations of motion**:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = 0
$$

This reformulation of Newton's mechanics is more powerful because:
1. It works in any coordinate system
2. It naturally handles constraints
3. It generalizes to field theory and quantum mechanics

**Noether's Theorem.** Every continuous symmetry of the Lagrangian gives rise to a conserved quantity. Time invariance gives conservation of energy; spatial invariance gives conservation of momentum; rotational invariance gives conservation of angular momentum.

## Second Variation and Sufficiency

The Euler–Lagrange equation gives **necessary** conditions (critical points). For **sufficiency** (minimizers), we need the **second variation**:

$$
\delta^2 J = \int_a^b \left[P(x)\eta'^2 + Q(x)\eta^2\right] dx \geq 0
$$

where $P = L_{y'y'}$ and $Q = L_{yy} - \frac{d}{dx}L_{yy'}$.

The condition $\delta^2 J \geq 0$ for all admissible $\eta$ is related to the **Jacobi equation** and **conjugate points** — an elegant theory connecting calculus of variations to Sturm–Liouville theory.

## Key Takeaways

1. The **calculus of variations** optimizes functionals over spaces of functions.
2. The **Euler–Lagrange equation** is the necessary condition for a critical point.
3. Classical problems like the **brachistochrone** and **geodesics** yield beautiful curves.
4. **Lagrangian mechanics** and **Noether's theorem** connect variational principles to the deepest laws of physics.
