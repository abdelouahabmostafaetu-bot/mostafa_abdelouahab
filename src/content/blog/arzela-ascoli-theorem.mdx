## Introduction

In finite dimensions, the **Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem** tells us that bounded sequences have convergent subsequences. In infinite-dimensional function spaces, boundedness alone is not enough — we need an additional condition called **equicontinuity**. The **Arzelà–Ascoli theorem** provides the precise characterization of compact subsets of $C(K)$.

## The Setting

Let $K$ be a compact metric space and $C(K)$ the space of continuous real-valued functions on $K$ with the supremum norm:

$$
\|f\|_\infty = \max_{x \in K} |f(x)|
$$

$C(K)$ is a Banach space — complete and infinite-dimensional.

## Key Definitions

A family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq C(K)$ is:

**Uniformly bounded** if there exists $M > 0$ such that:

$$
|f(x)| \leq M \quad \forall f \in \mathcal{F}, \; \forall x \in K
$$

**Equicontinuous** at $x_0 \in K$ if for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that:

$$
d(x, x_0) < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(x_0)| < \varepsilon \quad \forall f \in \mathcal{F}
$$

The key point: the same $\delta$ works for **all** functions in the family simultaneously.

$\mathcal{F}$ is **equicontinuous** if it is equicontinuous at every point.

## The Theorem

**Theorem (Arzelà–Ascoli).** Let $K$ be a compact metric space. A subset $\mathcal{F} \subseteq C(K)$ is **relatively compact** (its closure is compact) if and only if $\mathcal{F}$ is:

1. **Uniformly bounded**, and
2. **Equicontinuous**

Equivalently, every sequence in $\mathcal{F}$ has a **uniformly convergent** subsequence.

## Proof Sketch

### Necessity

If $\overline{\mathcal{F}}$ is compact, then it is totally bounded, which implies uniform boundedness. Equicontinuity follows from compactness and uniform continuity on $K$.

### Sufficiency (the important direction)

Let $(f_n)$ be a sequence in $\mathcal{F}$.

**Step 1.** Let $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots\}$ be a countable dense subset of $K$ (exists since $K$ is compact, hence separable).

**Step 2.** The sequence $(f_n(x_1))$ is bounded, so by BW, it has a convergent subsequence $(f_{n_k^{(1)}}(x_1))$.

**Step 3.** From this subsequence, extract a further subsequence converging at $x_2$. Continue diagonally.

**Step 4. (Diagonal argument)** The diagonal subsequence $g_k = f_{n_k^{(k)}}$ converges at every $x_j$.

**Step 5.** Use equicontinuity to promote pointwise convergence on a dense set to **uniform convergence** on all of $K$:

For any $\varepsilon > 0$, cover $K$ by finitely many balls of radius $\delta$ (equicontinuity). On each ball, $|g_m(x) - g_n(x)|$ is controlled by the value at the center (a dense point) plus $2\varepsilon$ from equicontinuity. $\blacksquare$

## Why Equicontinuity Is Necessary

Consider $f_n(x) = \sin(nx)$ on $[0, 2\pi]$. This family is uniformly bounded ($|f_n| \leq 1$) but **not equicontinuous**: at $x = 0$, $f_n(\pi/(2n)) = 1$ but $\pi/(2n) \to 0$.

Indeed, $(f_n)$ has **no uniformly convergent subsequence** — confirming that boundedness alone is insufficient.

## Application: Peano's Existence Theorem

**Theorem (Peano).** If $f(t, y)$ is continuous on a neighborhood of $(t_0, y_0)$, then $y' = f(t, y)$, $y(t_0) = y_0$ has at least one solution.

**Proof idea:** Construct approximate solutions $y_n$ (e.g., Euler polygons). Show they are:
1. **Uniformly bounded** (using bounds on $f$)
2. **Equicontinuous** (since $|y_n'| \leq M$, the family is Lipschitz with the same constant)

By Arzelà–Ascoli, extract a uniformly convergent subsequence. The limit is a solution. $\blacksquare$

## Application: Compact Operators

An operator $T: X \to Y$ between Banach spaces is **compact** if it maps bounded sets to relatively compact sets. By Arzelà–Ascoli, integral operators of the form:

$$
(Tf)(x) = \int_K G(x, y) f(y) \, dy
$$

are compact on $C(K)$ when the kernel $G$ is continuous — a key fact in the theory of integral equations and the Fredholm alternative.

## Key Takeaways

1. Arzelà–Ascoli characterizes compactness in $C(K)$: **uniform boundedness + equicontinuity**.
2. It replaces the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem in the infinite-dimensional setting.
3. The proof uses the **diagonal argument** — a technique that appears throughout analysis.
4. Applications include **existence theorems** for ODEs and the theory of **compact operators**.
