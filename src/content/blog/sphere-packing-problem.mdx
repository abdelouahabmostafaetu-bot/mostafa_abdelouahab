## Introduction

How should identical spheres be arranged to fill space as densely as possible? In 1611, Kepler conjectured that the face-centered cubic packing achieves the maximum density:

$$
\delta = \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.7405
$$

This was not proved until 1998 by Thomas Hales, using a computer-assisted proof formally verified in 2014.

## The Packing Density

For a packing $\mathcal{P}$ of unit spheres in $\mathbb{R}^3$:

$$
\delta(\mathcal{P}) = \lim_{R \to \infty} \frac{\text{Vol}(\mathcal{P} \cap B(0,R))}{\text{Vol}(B(0,R))}
$$

**FCC packing:** Each sphere touches 12 neighbors. The layers stack as ABCAB... with density $\frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{2}}$.

## In Other Dimensions

| Dimension | Densest packing | Density | Lattice |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $1$ | $1$ | $\mathbb{Z}$ |
| 2 | $\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{3}} \approx 0.9069$ | Hexagonal | $A_2$ |
| 3 | $\frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.7405$ | FCC | $A_3$ |
| 8 | $\frac{\pi^4}{384} \approx 0.2537$ | Viazovska (2016) | $E_8$ |
| 24 | $\frac{\pi^{12}}{12!} \approx 0.00193$ | CMSV (2016) | Leech |

Maryna Viazovska's proof of optimal sphere packing in 8 dimensions (2016) used modular forms and earned her a Fields Medal.

## Key Takeaways

1. Kepler's conjecture took 387 years to prove — one of the longest open problems.
2. Optimal packings in 8 and 24 dimensions have extraordinary connections to number theory and algebra.
3. Computer-assisted proofs raise interesting philosophical questions about mathematical certainty.
