## Introduction

The **heat equation** is the archetype of parabolic partial differential equations. It models the diffusion of heat, the spreading of concentration in chemical processes, and even the evolution of probability distributions under Brownian motion. Its mathematical properties — smoothing, maximum principles, and infinite speed of propagation — are as elegant as they are physically meaningful.

## The Equation

The heat equation in one spatial dimension is:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = k \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}, \; t > 0
$$

where $k > 0$ is the **thermal diffusivity**. For simplicity, we often normalize $k = 1$:

$$
u_t = u_{xx}
$$

In $n$ dimensions: $u_t = \Delta u$ where $\Delta = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_i^2}$ is the **Laplacian**.

## Separation of Variables

Consider the boundary value problem on $[0, L]$:

$$
u_t = k u_{xx}, \quad u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0, \quad u(x,0) = f(x)
$$

We seek solutions of the form $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting:

$$
\frac{T'}{kT} = \frac{X''}{X} = -\lambda
$$

This yields two ODEs:
- $X'' + \lambda X = 0$, $X(0) = X(L) = 0$ — eigenvalue problem
- $T' + k\lambda T = 0$

The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are:

$$
\lambda_n = \frac{n^2\pi^2}{L^2}, \quad X_n(x) = \sin\frac{n\pi x}{L}, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots
$$

The general solution is:

$$
u(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \sin\frac{n\pi x}{L} \, e^{-kn^2\pi^2 t/L^2}
$$

where $b_n = \frac{2}{L}\int_0^L f(x)\sin\frac{n\pi x}{L}\,dx$ are the **Fourier sine coefficients** of $f$.

**Key observation:** The exponential factors $e^{-kn^2\pi^2 t/L^2}$ decay rapidly for large $n$, meaning high-frequency oscillations are damped out. This is the **smoothing effect**.

## The Fundamental Solution

On all of $\mathbb{R}$, the heat equation with initial data $u(x,0) = f(x)$ is solved by convolution with the **heat kernel**:

$$
u(x,t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Phi(x-y, t) f(y) \, dy
$$

where the **fundamental solution** (heat kernel, Gaussian kernel) is:

$$
\Phi(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi kt}} \exp\left(-\frac{x^2}{4kt}\right), \quad t > 0
$$

### Properties of the Heat Kernel

1. $\Phi(x,t) > 0$ for all $x$ and $t > 0$
2. $\int_{-\infty}^\infty \Phi(x,t)\,dx = 1$ (it's a probability density)
3. $\Phi(\cdot, t) \to \delta$ as $t \to 0^+$ (converges to the Dirac delta)
4. $\Phi$ is $C^\infty$ for $t > 0$ — **even if $f$ is merely in $L^1$**

In $n$ dimensions:

$$
\Phi(x,t) = \frac{1}{(4\pi kt)^{n/2}} \exp\left(-\frac{|x|^2}{4kt}\right)
$$

## The Smoothing Effect

**Theorem.** If $f \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^n) \cap L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$, then the solution $u(x,t) = \Phi(\cdot, t) * f$ is $C^\infty$ for all $t > 0$.

This is remarkable: no matter how rough the initial data is (even a step function or a measure), the solution becomes infinitely smooth instantaneously. Diffusion is the ultimate regularizer.

**Contrast with the wave equation:** The wave equation preserves singularities; the heat equation destroys them immediately.

## Maximum Principles

**Weak Maximum Principle.** Let $u$ solve $u_t = \Delta u$ in a bounded domain $\Omega \times (0, T]$. Then:

$$
\max_{\overline{\Omega} \times [0,T]} u = \max_{\Gamma_T} u
$$

where $\Gamma_T = (\overline{\Omega} \times \{0\}) \cup (\partial\Omega \times [0, T])$ is the **parabolic boundary** (bottom and sides, but not the top).

The maximum of a solution is always attained on the parabolic boundary — heat cannot spontaneously concentrate.

**Strong Maximum Principle.** If $u$ attains its maximum at an interior point $(x_0, t_0)$ with $t_0 > 0$, then $u$ is constant on $\Omega \times [0, t_0]$.

### Consequences

1. **Uniqueness:** The maximum principle immediately gives uniqueness for the initial-boundary value problem.
2. **Stability:** If $\|f_1 - f_2\|_\infty < \varepsilon$, then $\|u_1 - u_2\|_\infty < \varepsilon$ for all $t > 0$.

## Energy Methods

Define the **heat energy**:

$$
E(t) = \frac{1}{2}\int_\Omega |u(x,t)|^2 \, dx
$$

Then:

$$
\frac{dE}{dt} = \int_\Omega u \cdot u_t \, dx = \int_\Omega u \cdot \Delta u \, dx = -\int_\Omega |\nabla u|^2 \, dx \leq 0
$$

The energy is **non-increasing** — the heat equation is dissipative.

## Connections to Probability

The heat kernel $\Phi(x,t)$ is the **transition density** of **Brownian motion**. If $B_t$ is a standard Brownian motion:

$$
\mathbb{P}(B_t \in A) = \int_A \Phi(x,t)\,dx
$$

The solution to the heat equation with initial data $f$ is:

$$
u(x,t) = \mathbb{E}[f(x + B_t)]
$$

This deep connection between PDEs and stochastic processes is the foundation of **stochastic analysis**.

## Key Takeaways

1. The **heat equation** is the prototypical parabolic PDE, modeling diffusion processes.
2. Solutions exhibit an instantaneous **smoothing effect** — initial irregularities are immediately resolved.
3. The **maximum principle** gives uniqueness, stability, and qualitative understanding.
4. The heat kernel connects PDEs to **probability** and Brownian motion.
