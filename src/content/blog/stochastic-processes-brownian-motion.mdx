## Introduction

A **stochastic process** is a collection of random variables indexed by time — a mathematical model for systems evolving randomly. From stock prices to diffusion of particles, from queueing networks to population genetics, stochastic processes are the language of randomness in motion. **Brownian motion**, the most important continuous-time process, lies at the foundation of modern probability and stochastic analysis.

## Markov Chains

A **Markov chain** is a stochastic process $\{X_n\}_{n \geq 0}$ on a countable state space $S$ satisfying the **Markov property**:

$$
\mathbb{P}(X_{n+1} = j \mid X_0, X_1, \ldots, X_n) = \mathbb{P}(X_{n+1} = j \mid X_n)
$$

The future depends on the past only through the present.

The **transition matrix** $P = (p_{ij})$ has entries $p_{ij} = \mathbb{P}(X_{n+1} = j \mid X_n = i)$.

**Stationary distribution:** A probability vector $\pi$ with $\pi P = \pi$. Under irreducibility and aperiodicity:

$$
P^n \to \mathbf{1}\pi^T \quad \text{as } n \to \infty
$$

The chain converges to its equilibrium.

## Random Walks

The **simple random walk** on $\mathbb{Z}$: start at 0, step $+1$ or $-1$ with equal probability.

**Theorem (Pólya).** The simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is recurrent (returns to the origin with probability 1) if and only if $d \leq 2$.

In dimensions 1 and 2, a random walker always returns home. In dimension 3 and above, there is a positive probability of never returning — "a drunk man will find his way home, but a drunk bird may get lost forever."

## Brownian Motion

**Definition.** A standard **Brownian motion** (Wiener process) $\{B_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ is a stochastic process satisfying:

1. $B_0 = 0$
2. **Independent increments:** $B_t - B_s$ is independent of $\{B_u : u \leq s\}$ for $s < t$
3. **Gaussian increments:** $B_t - B_s \sim N(0, t-s)$
4. $t \mapsto B_t$ is **continuous** almost surely

Brownian motion is the **scaling limit** of the random walk: if $S_n = X_1 + \cdots + X_n$ with $X_i$ i.i.d. of mean 0, variance 1, then:

$$
\frac{S_{\lfloor nt \rfloor}}{\sqrt{n}} \xrightarrow{d} B_t \quad \text{(Donsker's theorem)}
$$

### Properties of Brownian Paths

Brownian motion paths are almost surely:

1. **Continuous** everywhere
2. **Nowhere differentiable** — they are infinitely rough
3. **Of unbounded variation** on any interval — you cannot meaningfully integrate "with respect to $dB_t$" using classical calculus
4. **Hölder continuous** of any order $\alpha < 1/2$ but not for $\alpha = 1/2$

The **quadratic variation** of $B$ over $[0,t]$ is:

$$
\lim_{\|\Pi\| \to 0} \sum_{k} (B_{t_{k+1}} - B_{t_k})^2 = t \quad \text{a.s.}
$$

This non-zero quadratic variation is what makes Brownian motion fundamentally different from smooth functions and necessitates **Itô calculus**.

## Itô Calculus

Since Brownian paths have infinite variation, classical integration fails. **Itô's integral** is defined as a limit in $L^2$:

$$
\int_0^T f(t) \, dB_t = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_k f(t_k)(B_{t_{k+1}} - B_{t_k})
$$

**Itô's Formula.** If $f \in C^2$, then:

$$
f(B_t) = f(B_0) + \int_0^t f'(B_s) \, dB_s + \frac{1}{2}\int_0^t f''(B_s) \, ds
$$

The extra term $\frac{1}{2}f''$ — absent in classical calculus — arises from the nonzero quadratic variation of Brownian motion. This is the heart of stochastic calculus.

**Example.** $f(x) = x^2$:

$$
B_t^2 = 2\int_0^t B_s \, dB_s + t
$$

So $\int_0^t B_s \, dB_s = \frac{1}{2}(B_t^2 - t)$, not $\frac{1}{2}B_t^2$ as classical calculus would suggest.

## Stochastic Differential Equations

An **SDE** takes the form:

$$
dX_t = \mu(X_t, t)\,dt + \sigma(X_t, t)\,dB_t
$$

where $\mu$ is the **drift** and $\sigma$ is the **diffusion** coefficient.

**Geometric Brownian motion** — the model for stock prices:

$$
dS_t = \mu S_t \, dt + \sigma S_t \, dB_t
$$

Solution by Itô's formula:

$$
S_t = S_0 \exp\left((\mu - \sigma^2/2)t + \sigma B_t\right)
$$

## Connection to PDEs

**Feynman–Kac Formula.** The solution to:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \mu \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0, \quad u(x,T) = g(x)
$$

is given by:

$$
u(x,t) = \mathbb{E}[g(X_T) \mid X_t = x]
$$

where $X$ satisfies $dX = \mu\,dt + \sigma\,dB$.

This deep connection between SDEs and PDEs is the foundation of mathematical finance (Black–Scholes theory) and many areas of applied mathematics.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Markov chains** model discrete random evolution; Brownian motion is the continuous-time limit.
2. Brownian paths are **continuous but nowhere differentiable** — necessitating Itô calculus.
3. **Itô's formula** is the chain rule for stochastic calculus, with an extra second-order term.
4. The **Feynman–Kac formula** bridges stochastic processes and PDEs.
