## Introduction

In 1843, William Rowan Hamilton discovered the **quaternions** $\mathbb{H}$, a four-dimensional algebra extending the complex numbers. They are the most elegant way to represent rotations in three dimensions.

## Definition

A quaternion is $q = a + bi + cj + dk$ where $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}$ and:

$$
i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1
$$

This gives the multiplication rules: $ij = k$, $jk = i$, $ki = j$, $ji = -k$, $kj = -i$, $ik = -j$.

**Quaternion multiplication is not commutative!** This is the price of moving beyond $\mathbb{C}$.

## Representing Rotations

A **unit quaternion** $q$ with $|q| = 1$ represents a rotation by angle $\theta$ about axis $\hat{n} = (n_1, n_2, n_3)$:

$$
q = \cos\frac{\theta}{2} + \sin\frac{\theta}{2}(n_1 i + n_2 j + n_3 k)
$$

The rotation acts on vectors $v = v_1 i + v_2 j + v_3 k$ by:

$$
v' = qv\bar{q}
$$

## Advantages Over Matrices

1. **No gimbal lock** (unlike Euler angles)
2. **Smooth interpolation** (SLERP): $q(t) = q_0 \frac{\sin((1-t)\Omega)}{\sin\Omega} + q_1 \frac{\sin(t\Omega)}{\sin\Omega}$
3. **Compact representation**: 4 numbers vs. 9 for a rotation matrix
4. **Easy composition**: $q_{\text{total}} = q_2 q_1$

## Key Takeaways

1. Quaternions extend complex numbers at the cost of commutativity.
2. Unit quaternions are the most efficient representation of 3D rotations.
3. The map $q \mapsto qv\bar{q}$ gives a double cover $\text{SU}(2) \to \text{SO}(3)$.
