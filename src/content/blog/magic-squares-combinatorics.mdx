## Introduction

A **magic square** of order $n$ is an $n \times n$ array of distinct positive integers where every row, column, and main diagonal sums to the same **magic constant**:

$$
M = \frac{n(n^2 + 1)}{2}
$$

For $n = 3$: $M = 15$. For $n = 4$: $M = 34$.

## The Lo Shu Square

The oldest known magic square (China, ~2200 BCE):

$$
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 7 & 6 \\ 9 & 5 & 1 \\ 4 & 3 & 8 \end{pmatrix}
$$

Up to rotation and reflection, this is the **unique** $3 \times 3$ magic square.

## Algebraic Construction (Odd Order)

For odd $n$, the **Siamese method** works: place $1$ in the top center, then move diagonally up-right (wrapping around), and drop down one when blocked.

**General formula:** For odd $n$, a magic square is given by:

$$
a_{ij} = n\left((i + j - 1 + \lfloor n/2 \rfloor) \mod n\right) + \left((i + 2j - 2) \mod n\right) + 1
$$

## Latin Squares

A **Latin square** of order $n$ is an $n \times n$ array filled with $n$ different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and column. Two Latin squares are **orthogonal** if, when superimposed, each ordered pair occurs exactly once. Euler conjectured no pair of orthogonal Latin squares of order $n \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$ exists — this was **disproved** for all $n \geq 10$.

## Key Takeaways

1. The magic constant for order $n$ is $M = n(n^2+1)/2$.
2. Magic squares connect to Latin squares, orthogonal arrays, and combinatorial design theory.
3. There are exactly $275{,}305{,}224$ distinct $5 \times 5$ magic squares.
