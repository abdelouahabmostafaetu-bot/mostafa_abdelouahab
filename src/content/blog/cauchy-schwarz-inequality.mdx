## Introduction

The **Cauchy-Schwarz inequality** is arguably the single most useful inequality in all of mathematics. It appears in every branch and solves a remarkable variety of problems.

## The Inequality

In an inner product space:

$$
|\langle u, v \rangle|^2 \leq \langle u, u \rangle \cdot \langle v, v \rangle
$$

with equality if and only if $u$ and $v$ are linearly dependent.

**Finite form:** For real sequences $(a_k)$, $(b_k)$:

$$
\left(\sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k\right)^2 \leq \left(\sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2\right)\left(\sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2\right)
$$

**Integral form:**

$$
\left(\int_a^b f(x)g(x)\,dx\right)^2 \leq \int_a^b f(x)^2\,dx \cdot \int_a^b g(x)^2\,dx
$$

## One-Line Proof

For any $t \in \mathbb{R}$: $0 \leq \|u + tv\|^2 = \|u\|^2 + 2t\langle u,v\rangle + t^2\|v\|^2$. The discriminant of this quadratic in $t$ must be $\leq 0$:

$$
4\langle u,v\rangle^2 - 4\|u\|^2\|v\|^2 \leq 0 \implies |\langle u,v\rangle| \leq \|u\|\|v\| \quad \square
$$

## Applications

**Triangle inequality:** $\|u + v\| \leq \|u\| + \|v\|$ follows from Cauchy-Schwarz.

**Correlation bound:** For random variables, $|\text{Cor}(X,Y)| \leq 1$.

**Competition trick:** Prove $\frac{a^2}{x} + \frac{b^2}{y} + \frac{c^2}{z} \geq \frac{(a+b+c)^2}{x+y+z}$ (Titu's lemma, a consequence of CS).

## Key Takeaways

1. Cauchy-Schwarz is the foundation of all inner product space geometry.
2. The one-line quadratic proof is one of the most elegant arguments in analysis.
3. Titu's lemma (Engel form) is its most powerful competition variant.
