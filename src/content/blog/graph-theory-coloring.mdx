## Introduction

**Graph theory** began in 1736 when Leonhard Euler solved the Königsberg Bridge problem, and has since grown into one of the most vibrant areas of mathematics. Graphs model networks, relationships, and structures across combinatorics, computer science, biology, and social science. Their study reveals deep connections between combinatorics, algebra, and topology.

## Basic Definitions

A **graph** $G = (V, E)$ consists of a set $V$ of **vertices** and a set $E \subseteq \binom{V}{2}$ of **edges** (unordered pairs of vertices). We write $n = |V|$ and $m = |E|$.

**Degree:** $\deg(v) = |\{e \in E : v \in e\}|$.

**Handshaking Lemma:**

$$
\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2|E|
$$

**Corollary.** The number of vertices of odd degree is even.

## Eulerian and Hamiltonian Paths

**Euler's Theorem (1736).** A connected graph has an **Eulerian circuit** (a closed walk traversing every edge exactly once) if and only if every vertex has even degree.

**Hamiltonian paths** — paths visiting every vertex exactly once — have no such elegant characterization.

**Dirac's Theorem.** If $n \geq 3$ and $\deg(v) \geq n/2$ for all $v$, then $G$ has a Hamiltonian cycle.

**The Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete** — one of the fundamental problems of computational complexity.

## Trees

A **tree** is a connected acyclic graph.

**Theorem.** For a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the following are equivalent:
1. $G$ is a tree
2. $G$ is connected with $n-1$ edges
3. $G$ is acyclic with $n-1$ edges
4. There is a unique path between any two vertices

**Cayley's Formula.** The number of labeled trees on $n$ vertices is $n^{n-2}$.

$$
|\{\text{labeled trees on } [n]\}| = n^{n-2}
$$

For $n = 4$: $4^2 = 16$ labeled trees. Prüfer's proof uses a bijection with sequences in $[n]^{n-2}$.

## Planarity and Euler's Formula

A graph is **planar** if it can be drawn in the plane without edge crossings.

**Euler's Formula.** For a connected planar graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and $f$ faces:

$$
n - m + f = 2
$$

**Corollary.** For a simple planar graph with $n \geq 3$: $m \leq 3n - 6$.

This immediately implies:
- $K_5$ (5 vertices, 10 edges) is **not planar**: $10 > 3(5) - 6 = 9$.
- $K_{3,3}$ (6 vertices, 9 edges) is not planar by a refined argument ($m \leq 2n-4$ for triangle-free graphs).

**Kuratowski's Theorem.** A graph is planar if and only if it contains no subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$.

## Graph Coloring

A **proper $k$-coloring** of $G$ assigns colors $\{1, \ldots, k\}$ to vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share a color.

The **chromatic number** $\chi(G)$ is the minimum $k$ for which a proper $k$-coloring exists.

**Examples:**
- $\chi(K_n) = n$
- $\chi(C_{2k+1}) = 3$ (odd cycle)
- $\chi(G) = 2$ if and only if $G$ is bipartite

### The Chromatic Polynomial

The **chromatic polynomial** $P(G, k)$ counts the number of proper $k$-colorings.

**Deletion-contraction:**

$$
P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)
$$

where $G - e$ deletes edge $e$ and $G/e$ contracts it.

**Example.** For the path $P_n$: $P(P_n, k) = k(k-1)^{n-1}$.

**Example.** For the cycle $C_n$: $P(C_n, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1)$.

## The Four Color Theorem

**Theorem (Appel and Haken, 1976).** Every planar graph is 4-colorable: $\chi(G) \leq 4$ for all planar $G$.

This was the first major theorem proved with essential computer assistance — the proof checked 1,936 reducible configurations. A simpler proof by Robertson, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas (1997) reduced this to 633 configurations.

**Historical context:**
- Conjectured by Guthrie (1852)
- Kempe's "proof" (1879) had a flaw found by Heawood (1890)
- Kempe's method does prove the **Five Color Theorem** — a clean, short proof

**The Five Color Theorem** is much easier: every planar graph has a vertex of degree $\leq 5$ (by Euler's formula), and an inductive argument using Kempe chains gives a 5-coloring.

## Spectral Graph Theory

The **adjacency matrix** $A$ of a graph $G$ has entries $A_{ij} = 1$ if $\{i,j\} \in E$.

The **Laplacian** $L = D - A$ where $D = \text{diag}(\deg(v_1), \ldots, \deg(v_n))$.

**Theorem.** $L$ is positive semidefinite, and the multiplicity of eigenvalue 0 equals the number of connected components.

The second smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_2(L)$ — the **Fiedler value** or algebraic connectivity — measures how well-connected the graph is.

**Cheeger's inequality** relates $\lambda_2$ to the edge expansion of the graph, bridging spectral and combinatorial properties.

## Ramsey Theory

**Theorem (Ramsey).** For all positive integers $r, s$, there exists $R(r,s)$ such that any 2-coloring of $K_n$ with $n \geq R(r,s)$ contains a red $K_r$ or a blue $K_s$.

Known values are few: $R(3,3) = 6$, $R(4,4) = 18$, $R(5,5)$ is unknown (between 43 and 48).

Erdős's famous quote: if aliens demanded the value of $R(5,5)$, we should marshal all our computers; if they demanded $R(6,6)$, we should attack.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Euler's formula** $n - m + f = 2$ is the cornerstone of planar graph theory.
2. **Graph coloring** is characterized by the chromatic number and chromatic polynomial.
3. The **Four Color Theorem** required computer assistance and remains philosophically provocative.
4. **Spectral methods** connect graph structure to eigenvalues of the Laplacian.
