## Introduction

**Compactness** is arguably the single most important concept in topology and analysis. It is the precise property that allows us to pass from infinite to finite — to extract convergent subsequences, to attain maxima, to make uniform estimates. As Jean Dieudonné wrote, compactness is the topologist's substitute for finiteness.

## Definitions

A topological space $X$ is **compact** if every open cover has a finite subcover: whenever $X = \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} U_\alpha$ with each $U_\alpha$ open, there exist finitely many indices $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n$ such that:

$$
X = U_{\alpha_1} \cup U_{\alpha_2} \cup \cdots \cup U_{\alpha_n}
$$

A subset $K \subseteq X$ is compact if it is compact as a subspace.

**Equivalent characterizations** (in general topological spaces):
1. Every open cover has a finite subcover (definition)
2. Every collection of closed sets with the **finite intersection property** has nonempty intersection
3. Every net has a convergent subnet
4. Every ultrafilter converges

## The Heine–Borel Theorem

**Theorem (Heine–Borel).** A subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is compact if and only if it is **closed and bounded**.

This beautiful equivalence holds specifically in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In general metric spaces:

- Compact $\Rightarrow$ closed and bounded (**always true**)
- Closed and bounded $\Rightarrow$ compact (**not always true**)

**Counterexample:** In the space $\ell^\infty$ of bounded sequences, the closed unit ball $\overline{B}(0,1)$ is closed and bounded but **not compact**. The sequence $e_1, e_2, e_3, \ldots$ (standard basis vectors) has no convergent subsequence since $\|e_n - e_m\| = 1$ for $n \neq m$.

## Sequential Compactness

A space is **sequentially compact** if every sequence has a convergent subsequence.

**In metric spaces,** compactness, sequential compactness, and limit point compactness are all equivalent. In general topological spaces, they diverge.

## Key Properties

**1. Continuous image of compact is compact.** If $f: X \to Y$ is continuous, $X$ compact $\Rightarrow$ $f(X)$ compact.

**2. Extreme Value Theorem.** A continuous real-valued function on a compact space attains its maximum and minimum.

**3. Closed subset of compact is compact.** If $K$ is compact and $F \subseteq K$ is closed, then $F$ is compact.

**4. Compact in Hausdorff is closed.** If $X$ is Hausdorff and $K \subseteq X$ is compact, then $K$ is closed.

**5. Continuous bijection from compact to Hausdorff is a homeomorphism.**

## Compactness in Metric Spaces

In metric spaces, compactness has an elegant characterization:

**Theorem.** For a metric space $(X, d)$, the following are equivalent:
1. $X$ is compact
2. $X$ is sequentially compact
3. $X$ is **complete** and **totally bounded**

A space is **totally bounded** if for every $\varepsilon > 0$, it can be covered by finitely many balls of radius $\varepsilon$.

## Tychonoff's Theorem

**Theorem (Tychonoff).** The product of any collection of compact spaces is compact (in the product topology).

$$
\text{If each } X_\alpha \text{ is compact, then } \prod_{\alpha \in A} X_\alpha \text{ is compact.}
$$

This is one of the deepest theorems in topology. For finite products, the proof is elementary. For arbitrary products, the proof requires the **axiom of choice** — and in fact, Tychonoff's theorem is equivalent to the axiom of choice!

### Applications of Tychonoff's Theorem

1. **Banach–Alaoglu:** The closed unit ball in $X^*$ is weak-* compact.
2. **Stone–Čech compactification:** Every completely regular space has a unique (up to homeomorphism) maximal compactification.
3. **Existence of ultrafilters:** Every filter can be extended to an ultrafilter.

## Compactifications

Given a non-compact space $X$, a **compactification** is a compact space $Y$ containing $X$ as a dense subspace.

**One-point compactification.** Adjoin a single point $\infty$: $X^* = X \cup \{\infty\}$. Open sets in $X^*$ are open sets of $X$ together with complements of compact subsets.

Example: $\mathbb{R}^n \cup \{\infty\} \cong S^n$ — the one-point compactification of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the $n$-sphere.

## Compact Operators

In functional analysis, a linear operator $T: X \to Y$ between Banach spaces is **compact** if it maps bounded sets to relatively compact sets (sets with compact closure). Compact operators form a closed ideal in $\mathcal{L}(X, Y)$ and have a rich spectral theory.

**Theorem (Riesz).** The identity operator $I: X \to X$ is compact if and only if $\dim X < \infty$.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Compactness** extracts finite information from infinite structures.
2. In $\mathbb{R}^n$, compactness = closed + bounded (**Heine–Borel**).
3. In metric spaces, compactness = completeness + total boundedness.
4. **Tychonoff's theorem** extends compactness to arbitrary products, equivalent to the axiom of choice.
