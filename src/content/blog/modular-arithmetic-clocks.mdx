## Introduction

**Modular arithmetic** works with remainders. We write $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ if $n \mid (a - b)$. A clock is a natural model: $15 \equiv 3 \pmod{12}$.

## The Ring $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$

The integers modulo $n$ form a **ring** with $n$ elements. Its structure depends on $n$:

- If $n = p$ (prime), $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is a **field** — every non-zero element has an inverse.
- If $n$ is composite, $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ has **zero divisors**: $2 \cdot 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{6}$.

## Fermat's Little Theorem

**Theorem.** If $p$ is prime and $\gcd(a, p) = 1$:

$$
a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}
$$

**Euler's generalization:** $a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$ when $\gcd(a, n) = 1$, where $\varphi(n) = n \prod_{p|n}(1 - 1/p)$ is Euler's totient.

## Chinese Remainder Theorem

If $\gcd(m, n) = 1$, the system:

$$
x \equiv a \pmod{m}, \quad x \equiv b \pmod{n}
$$

has a unique solution modulo $mn$. Algebraically: $\mathbb{Z}/mn\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$.

## Application: RSA Cryptography

Choose primes $p, q$. Let $n = pq$ and $e$ with $\gcd(e, \varphi(n)) = 1$. The RSA encryption:

$$
c \equiv m^e \pmod{n}, \qquad m \equiv c^d \pmod{n}
$$

where $ed \equiv 1 \pmod{\varphi(n)}$. Security relies on the difficulty of factoring $n$.

## Key Takeaways

1. $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is a field — the foundation of finite field theory.
2. Fermat and Euler's theorems are the backbone of number-theoretic cryptography.
3. CRT decomposes problems into simpler modular components.
