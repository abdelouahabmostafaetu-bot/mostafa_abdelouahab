## Introduction

Every mathematics student encounters problems they cannot immediately solve. The difference between students who thrive and those who struggle is not raw intelligence — it is their **problem-solving strategy**. Over decades of teaching and observing students at all levels, certain patterns are unmistakable: successful students approach problems systematically, while struggling students either give up prematurely or thrash inefficiently.

George Pólya's classic *How to Solve It* (1945) laid the foundation for teaching mathematical problem-solving. What follows is a refined version of his framework, augmented with strategies I have found effective in practice.

## Pólya's Four-Step Framework

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

Before attempting a solution, ensure you understand what is being asked.

**Ask yourself:**
- What are the **unknowns**? What am I trying to find or prove?
- What are the **data**? What information is given?
- What are the **conditions**? What constraints apply?
- Can I **restate the problem** in my own words?
- Can I draw a **diagram or picture**?
- Do I know a **related problem**?

**The most common mistake students make is starting to compute before understanding the problem.** I estimate that 40% of student errors come from misunderstanding what is being asked.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan

Choose a strategy. Here are the most important ones in university mathematics:

#### Strategy 1: Work Examples First

If a problem asks you to prove a general statement, **try specific cases first**:
- Compute the answer for $n = 1, 2, 3, 4$
- Test the statement with your favorite examples
- Look for patterns

Examples don't prove the general case, but they often reveal the structure of the proof.

#### Strategy 2: Work Backwards

**To prove $Q$, ask: what would be sufficient to conclude $Q$?**

If you need $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$, ask: what condition on $x$ would guarantee this? This is how epsilon-delta proofs are discovered — working backwards from what you need, then writing the proof forwards.

#### Strategy 3: Consider Extreme or Special Cases

- What happens when $n = 0$ or $n = 1$?
- What if the function is constant?
- What if the matrix is diagonal?
- What if the space is $\mathbb{R}$ (instead of a general metric space)?

Special cases often reveal the mechanism of the general proof.

#### Strategy 4: Exploit Symmetry and Structure

- Is there a **group action** that simplifies the problem?
- Are there **invariants** — quantities that don't change?
- Can you use **symmetry** to reduce cases?

#### Strategy 5: Use the Right Representation

The same mathematical object can be represented in many ways. Choose the representation that makes the problem easiest:
- A linear map can be a matrix, a formula, or a geometric transformation
- An integer can be written in decimal, binary, or prime factorization
- A complex number can be Cartesian or polar

**The right representation often makes the problem trivial.**

#### Strategy 6: Reduce to a Known Problem

Can you transform the problem into one you've already solved? This is one of the most powerful strategies in mathematics:
- Change variables in an integral to get a known form
- Apply a bijection to reduce a counting problem
- Use a coordinate change to simplify a PDE

### Step 3: Execute the Plan

Carry out your strategy carefully. **Check each step** as you go.

**Critical discipline:** If your approach isn't working after sustained effort, **step back and reconsider**. Don't spend three hours on an approach that isn't leading anywhere. This is where students with a toolbox of strategies have an advantage — they can switch approaches.

### Step 4: Look Back

After solving, reflect:
- **Is the answer reasonable?** Does it agree with special cases and intuition?
- **Can I verify the result** independently (substitute back, check boundaries, numerical test)?
- **Can I solve the problem a different way?**
- **Can I generalize the result?** What happens if I weaken a hypothesis?
- **What was the key idea?** How might I use it again?

**Looking back is the step most students skip, and it's the most valuable for long-term learning.**

## Concrete Techniques for Common Problem Types

### Proving Equalities

To show $A = B$:
- Show $A \leq B$ and $B \leq A$ (for numerical equalities)
- Show $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$ (for sets)
- Start from one side and transform to the other
- Show both equal a third quantity $C$

### Proving Inequalities

- **AM-GM, Cauchy-Schwarz, Jensen's** — learn the standard inequalities cold
- **Calculus:** Show $f(x) - g(x) \geq 0$ by finding the minimum
- **Induction:** Often works for discrete inequalities
- **Convexity/concavity:** Use Jensen's inequality

### Proving Existence

- **Construction:** Build the object explicitly
- **Fixed point theorems:** Banach, Brouwer, Schauder
- **Compactness arguments:** Use sequential compactness or open covers
- **Zorn's lemma:** When the object is maximal

### Proving Uniqueness

- **Direct:** Assume two solutions exist, show they're equal
- **Contraction:** If the solution is a fixed point of a contraction, it's unique
- **Energy methods:** Show a functional has a strict minimum

## Managing Frustration and Stuck Moments

Being stuck is the natural state of a mathematician. Here are strategies for productive stuckness:

1. **Take a break.** Walk, sleep, exercise. Your subconscious continues working.

2. **Change your approach.** If direct proof isn't working, try contradiction. If algebra isn't working, try geometry.

3. **Read the definitions again.** Solutions often hide in the precise statements of definitions.

4. **Look for the simplest non-trivial case** you haven't tried.

5. **Talk to someone.** Explaining what you've tried and where you're stuck often triggers insight — even before the other person responds.

6. **Check your assumptions.** Are you sure the statement is true? Try to find a counterexample. If you find one, you've learned something important. If you can't, you've strengthened your conviction and may see why the statement is true.

## Building Your Problem-Solving Toolbox

The best problem-solvers have a large library of **techniques** and **examples** that they can draw on. Build yours deliberately:

- **Keep a notebook** of solved problems organized by technique
- **Identify the "trick"** in every solution you encounter
- **Catalog useful inequalities,** identities, and counterexamples
- **Practice regularly** with problem books (see below)

## Recommended Problem Books

- *Problems in Mathematical Analysis* by Kaczor and Nowak — excellent for analysis
- *Problems in Real Analysis* by Aliprantis and Burkinshaw — advanced and thorough
- *Linear Algebra Problem Book* by Halmos — teaches through problems
- *Putnam and Beyond* by Gelca and Andreescu — for competition-style problem solving
- *Berkeley Problems in Mathematics* — qualifying exam problems

## Final Thought

Problem-solving is a skill. Like any skill, it improves with deliberate practice and deteriorates with neglect. The students who become the strongest mathematicians are not the ones who find mathematics easy — they are the ones who **persist intelligently** when it is hard.
