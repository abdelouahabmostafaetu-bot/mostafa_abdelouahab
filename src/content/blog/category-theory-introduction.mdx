## Introduction

**Category theory** is the study of mathematical structure at the highest level of abstraction. Rather than studying individual mathematical objects — groups, spaces, modules — it studies the relationships (morphisms) between them. As Saunders Mac Lane, one of its founders, wrote: "The subject has a tendency to strip away the irrelevant and focus on what truly matters."

## Categories

A **category** $\mathcal{C}$ consists of:
1. A collection $\text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ of **objects**
2. For each pair $A, B$, a collection $\text{Hom}(A, B)$ of **morphisms** (arrows)
3. A **composition** law: $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to C$ give $g \circ f: A \to C$
4. **Identity morphisms** $\text{id}_A: A \to A$ for each object

satisfying associativity and the identity law.

### Examples

| Category | Objects | Morphisms |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| $\mathbf{Set}$ | Sets | Functions |
| $\mathbf{Grp}$ | Groups | Group homomorphisms |
| $\mathbf{Top}$ | Topological spaces | Continuous maps |
| $\mathbf{Vect}_K$ | $K$-vector spaces | Linear maps |
| $\mathbf{Ring}$ | Rings | Ring homomorphisms |

But also more exotic categories:
- Any **poset** $(P, \leq)$ is a category: objects are elements, and there is a unique morphism $a \to b$ iff $a \leq b$.
- Any **group** $G$ is a category with one object and morphisms = elements of $G$.

## Functors

A **functor** $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ maps objects to objects and morphisms to morphisms, preserving composition and identities:

$$
F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ F(f), \quad F(\text{id}_A) = \text{id}_{F(A)}
$$

**Covariant functors** preserve direction; **contravariant functors** reverse arrows ($F: \mathcal{C}^{op} \to \mathcal{D}$).

### Examples of Functors

1. **Forgetful functor** $U: \mathbf{Grp} \to \mathbf{Set}$ — "forgets" the group structure.
2. **Free functor** $F: \mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Grp}$ — sends a set to the free group on it.
3. **Fundamental group** $\pi_1: \mathbf{Top}_* \to \mathbf{Grp}$ — a functor from pointed spaces to groups.
4. **Dual space** $(-)^*: \mathbf{Vect}_K^{op} \to \mathbf{Vect}_K$ — a contravariant functor.
5. **Homology** $H_n: \mathbf{Top} \to \mathbf{Ab}$ — a functor from spaces to abelian groups.

## Natural Transformations

A **natural transformation** $\eta: F \Rightarrow G$ between functors $F, G: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ consists of morphisms $\eta_A: F(A) \to G(A)$ for each object $A$, making the following diagram commute for every morphism $f: A \to B$:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
F(A) & \xrightarrow{\eta_A} & G(A) \\
\downarrow^{F(f)} & & \downarrow^{G(f)} \\
F(B) & \xrightarrow{\eta_B} & G(B)
\end{array}
$$

**Example.** The determinant $\det: GL_n \Rightarrow (-)^\times$ is a natural transformation from the functor $R \mapsto GL_n(R)$ to the functor $R \mapsto R^\times$.

**Example.** The canonical embedding $\eta_V: V \to V^{**}$ is a natural transformation from the identity functor to the double dual functor.

Natural transformations are "morphisms between functors," and this leads to **functor categories** $[\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D}]$.

## Universal Properties

Category theory's greatest insight: **define objects by what they do, not what they are.**

A **universal property** characterizes an object (up to unique isomorphism) by a mapping property.

### Products

The **product** $A \times B$ is an object with projections $\pi_1: A \times B \to A$, $\pi_2: A \times B \to B$ such that for any object $C$ with maps $f: C \to A$, $g: C \to B$, there exists a unique $h: C \to A \times B$ with $\pi_1 \circ h = f$ and $\pi_2 \circ h = g$.

### Coproducts

The **coproduct** $A \sqcup B$ is the dual notion — in $\mathbf{Set}$, it's the disjoint union; in $\mathbf{Ab}$, it's the direct sum; in $\mathbf{Top}$, it's the disjoint union.

## The Yoneda Lemma

**Theorem (Yoneda).** Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a locally small category, $F: \mathcal{C}^{op} \to \mathbf{Set}$ a (contravariant) functor, and $A \in \mathcal{C}$. Then:

$$
\text{Nat}(\text{Hom}(-, A), F) \cong F(A)
$$

naturally in both $A$ and $F$.

**Corollary (Yoneda Embedding).** The functor $\mathcal{C} \to [\mathcal{C}^{op}, \mathbf{Set}]$ given by $A \mapsto \text{Hom}(-, A)$ is **fully faithful**. In particular:

$$
A \cong B \iff \text{Hom}(-, A) \cong \text{Hom}(-, B)
$$

**Meaning:** An object is completely determined by how other objects map into it. This is the formalization of the principle: **an object is the sum of its relationships.**

## Adjunctions

An **adjunction** $F \dashv G$ between functors $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ and $G: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{C}$ consists of a natural bijection:

$$
\text{Hom}_\mathcal{D}(F(A), B) \cong \text{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(A, G(B))
$$

$F$ is the **left adjoint**, $G$ the **right adjoint**.

### Examples

| Left Adjoint $F$ | Right Adjoint $G$ | Category |
|------|------|------|
| Free group | Forgetful | $\mathbf{Set} \rightleftarrows \mathbf{Grp}$ |
| $- \otimes M$ | $\text{Hom}(M, -)$ | $R$-$\mathbf{Mod}$ |
| $f^*$ (inverse image sheaf) | $f_*$ (direct image) | Sheaves |
| Suspension $\Sigma$ | Loop space $\Omega$ | $\mathbf{Top}_*$ |

Adjunctions are ubiquitous — Mac Lane argued that "all concepts are Kan extensions," and all Kan extensions reduce to adjunctions.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Categories** consist of objects and morphisms; they capture mathematical structure in its purest form.
2. **Functors** are structure-preserving maps between categories.
3. **Natural transformations** are "morphisms between functors."
4. The **Yoneda lemma** says an object is determined by its relationships.
5. **Adjunctions** formalize the duality between "free" and "forgetful" constructions.
