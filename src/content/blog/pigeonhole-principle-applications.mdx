## Introduction

The **pigeonhole principle** states: if $n+1$ objects are placed into $n$ containers, at least one container holds at least two objects. Despite its simplicity, it is one of the most powerful tools in mathematics.

## Classic Applications

**Theorem.** Among any 5 points in a unit square, at least two are within distance $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

*Proof.* Divide the square into 4 equal sub-squares of side $\frac{1}{2}$. By pigeonhole, some sub-square contains $\geq 2$ points. The maximum distance within a sub-square is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. $\square$

**Theorem.** For any irrational $\alpha$ and any $n$, there exist integers $p, q$ with $1 \leq q \leq n$ and:

$$
\left|\alpha - \frac{p}{q}\right| < \frac{1}{q(n+1)}
$$

*Proof.* Consider $\{0\}, \{\alpha\}, \{2\alpha\}, \ldots, \{n\alpha\}$ (fractional parts). These are $n+1$ numbers in $[0,1)$. Divide into $n$ subintervals. By pigeonhole, two fractional parts lie in the same subinterval. $\square$

## Generalized Pigeonhole Principle

If $n$ objects are placed in $k$ containers, some container has at least $\lceil n/k \rceil$ objects.

**Application:** Among any 27 words in English, at least two start with the same letter (since there are only 26 letters).

## Key Takeaways

1. Pigeonhole is non-constructive — it proves existence without finding the object.
2. It's the foundation of **Dirichlet's approximation theorem** in number theory.
3. The generalized version handles unequal distributions elegantly.
