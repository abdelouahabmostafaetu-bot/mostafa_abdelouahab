## Introduction

**Ordinary differential equations** (ODEs) are equations involving an unknown function and its derivatives. They are the primary language for modelling continuous dynamical processes in physics, biology, economics, and engineering. In this post, we focus on the **theoretical foundations**: existence, uniqueness, and qualitative behavior of solutions.

## The Initial Value Problem

The fundamental problem: given $f: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ and an initial condition $(t_0, y_0)$, find $y: I \to \mathbb{R}^n$ satisfying:

$$
\begin{cases}
y'(t) = f(t, y(t)) \\
y(t_0) = y_0
\end{cases}
$$

### Integral Formulation

The IVP is equivalent to the integral equation:

$$
y(t) = y_0 + \int_{t_0}^{t} f(s, y(s)) \, ds
$$

This formulation is the key to proving existence.

## The Picard–Lindelöf Theorem

**Theorem.** Let $f: U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be continuous on an open set $U \ni (t_0, y_0)$ and **Lipschitz continuous** in $y$: there exists $L > 0$ such that:

$$
\|f(t, y_1) - f(t, y_2)\| \leq L \|y_1 - y_2\|
$$

for all $(t, y_1), (t, y_2)$ in $U$. Then there exists a unique solution to the IVP on some interval $[t_0 - \delta, t_0 + \delta]$.

### Proof via the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem

Define the operator $T$ on $C([t_0 - \delta, t_0 + \delta], \mathbb{R}^n)$:

$$
(Ty)(t) = y_0 + \int_{t_0}^{t} f(s, y(s)) \, ds
$$

For sufficiently small $\delta$, $T$ is a contraction (with constant $k = L\delta < 1$). By the Banach fixed-point theorem, $T$ has a unique fixed point — which is the unique solution.

## The Peano Existence Theorem

If we only assume $f$ is **continuous** (without Lipschitz), we lose uniqueness but retain existence:

**Theorem (Peano, 1890).** If $f$ is continuous on a neighborhood of $(t_0, y_0)$, then the IVP has at least one local solution.

**Counterexample to uniqueness:** $y' = \sqrt{|y|}$, $y(0) = 0$ has infinitely many solutions, including $y(t) = 0$ and $y(t) = \frac{1}{4}t^2$ for $t \geq 0$.

## Linear Systems

For the linear system $y' = A(t)y + g(t)$ with $A(t)$ continuous, solutions exist globally and the solution space has beautiful structure.

### Constant Coefficients

When $A$ is constant, the solution is:

$$
y(t) = e^{At} y_0 + \int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} g(s) \, ds
$$

where the **matrix exponential** is:

$$
e^{At} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(At)^k}{k!}
$$

## Phase Portraits and Stability

For the autonomous system $y' = f(y)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the qualitative behavior near an equilibrium $y^* $ (where $f(y^*) = 0$) is determined by the eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ of the Jacobian $Df(y^*)$:

| Eigenvalues | Classification | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 < 0$ | Stable node | Asymptotically stable |
| $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 > 0$ | Unstable node | Unstable |
| $\lambda_1 < 0 < \lambda_2$ | Saddle point | Unstable |
| $\alpha \pm i\beta$, $\alpha < 0$ | Stable spiral | Asymptotically stable |
| $\alpha \pm i\beta$, $\alpha > 0$ | Unstable spiral | Unstable |
| $\pm i\beta$ | Center | Stable (not asymptotically) |

## Lyapunov Stability Theory

A more general approach to stability uses **Lyapunov functions**:

**Theorem (Lyapunov).** Let $y^*$ be an equilibrium. If there exists a continuously differentiable function $V: U \to \mathbb{R}$ such that:
1. $V(y^*) = 0$ and $V(y) > 0$ for $y \neq y^*$
2. $\dot{V}(y) = \nabla V \cdot f(y) \leq 0$

then $y^*$ is **stable**. If $\dot{V}(y) < 0$ for $y \neq y^*$, then $y^*$ is **asymptotically stable**.

The function $V$ acts as a generalized "energy" that doesn't increase along solutions.

## Key Takeaways

1. The **Picard–Lindelöf theorem** provides existence and uniqueness under a Lipschitz condition — proved elegantly via the Banach fixed-point theorem.
2. **Continuity alone** gives existence but not uniqueness (Peano's theorem).
3. **Phase portraits** and **eigenvalue analysis** characterize behavior near equilibria.
4. **Lyapunov theory** provides a powerful, coordinate-free approach to stability without solving the equation.
