## Introduction

Applying to graduate school in mathematics is one of the most consequential decisions in a mathematician's early career. The process is opaque: unlike law or medical school, there is no standardized test that determines admission, no clear checklist of requirements, and the unwritten expectations vary widely between programs. Having served on admissions committees and mentored dozens of students through the application process, I want to make the path clearer.

This guide is aimed at undergraduate students in their second or third year who are considering a PhD in mathematics. If you're earlier in your studies, excellent — you have time to prepare deliberately. If you're in your final year, much of this still applies, and some strategies can be executed quickly.

## What Admissions Committees Look For

### 1. Strong Performance in Advanced Courses

The most important factor is your performance in **proof-based, upper-division mathematics courses**. Committees care most about:

- **Real Analysis** (at the level of Rudin's *Principles* or equivalent)
- **Abstract Algebra** (groups, rings, fields, Galois theory)
- **Topology** (point-set topology, ideally some algebraic topology)
- **Complex Analysis**
- **Graduate-level courses** — taking and succeeding in graduate courses as an undergraduate is the strongest signal

**An A in real analysis means more than an A+ in multivariable calculus.** Committees understand the difference in difficulty and look at the level of courses, not just the GPA.

### 2. Letters of Recommendation

After coursework, **letters of recommendation** are the most important component. You need three strong letters, ideally from mathematicians who know you well and can speak to your mathematical ability, not just your grade.

**How to get strong letters:**
- **Attend office hours** regularly — professors need to know you personally
- **Ask thoughtful questions** — this is how professors assess mathematical talent
- **Take multiple courses** with the same professor if possible
- **Do research or independent study** with a professor — this generates the strongest letters
- **Ask early** — at least one month before the deadline

**A letter that says "This student earned an A in my class" is weak.** A letter that says "This student asked a question in office hours that I hadn't considered, and we spent an hour discussing it" is strong.

### 3. Research Experience

Research experience is **valuable but not required** for most PhD programs. What matters is evidence of mathematical initiative and the ability to engage with mathematics beyond the standard curriculum:

- **REUs** (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) — competitive summer programs, exceptionally valuable
- **Senior thesis or honors project** — demonstrates sustained mathematical work
- **Independent reading courses** — studying a topic beyond the standard curriculum
- **Participation in math competitions** — less important than courses, but shows talent

### 4. The Personal Statement

Your statement should convey:
- **What areas of mathematics excite you** and why
- **Your mathematical background** — what have you studied beyond the requirements?
- **Specific research interests** — even if preliminary
- **Why this program?** — mention specific faculty whose work interests you
- **Your trajectory** — how you got here and where you're going

**Keep it honest and specific.** Generic enthusiasm for "the beauty of mathematics" is less compelling than a specific account of a theorem that captivated you and the questions it raised.

### 5. The GRE

**The GRE Subject Test in Mathematics** is being phased out by many programs but is still required by some. If required:
- It tests undergraduate material: calculus, linear algebra, abstract algebra, real analysis
- **Practice extensively** — the test rewards speed as much as knowledge
- A score above the 80th percentile is generally sufficient for top-25 programs
- A low score can hurt; a high score rarely decisively helps

**Check each program's requirements.** Many top departments have dropped the GRE.

## The Ideal Undergraduate Preparation

### Courses to Take

**By the end of year 2:**
- Multivariable calculus and linear algebra (including proofs)
- Introduction to proofs / discrete mathematics
- Begin real analysis or abstract algebra

**By the end of year 3:**
- Real analysis I and II (sequences, continuity, differentiation, integration, metric spaces)
- Abstract algebra I and II (groups, rings, fields, ideally Galois theory)
- Point-set topology
- Complex analysis

**Year 4 — aim for at least 2–3 of these:**
- Graduate real analysis (measure theory, $L^p$ spaces, Lebesgue integration)
- Graduate algebra (commutative algebra, representation theory, homological algebra)
- Differential geometry or algebraic topology
- Functional analysis
- Algebraic geometry or number theory
- Partial differential equations
- Probability theory

**Key principle:** Depth matters more than breadth. It is better to master real analysis and algebra deeply than to take a superficial tour of many topics.

### Building Relationships with Faculty

- Take multiple courses from the same professors — this is how relationships develop
- Attend **colloquia and seminars** — even if you understand only 10%, your presence shows seriousness and you'll gradually understand more
- Ask about **reading courses** — study a book with a professor one-on-one
- Join or start a **student math club** or seminar

### Research Opportunities

- **Apply to REUs** after your sophomore or junior year — these are the gold standard for undergraduate research
- **Talk to your professors** about potential research projects — many have accessible problems suitable for undergraduates
- **Write a senior thesis** — even if not required, it demonstrates independence and depth
- **Attend workshops and conferences** — many have funding for undergraduates

## Choosing Programs

### Research Fit

The most important factor in choosing a PhD program is **research fit**: does the department have faculty working in areas you're interested in? At least 2–3 potential advisors is ideal, since interests can change.

### Funding

Virtually all PhD programs in mathematics offer **full funding**: tuition waiver plus a stipend (for teaching or research). If a program does not offer funding, think very carefully before attending.

### Culture and Environment

Visit if possible (many programs host prospective student weekends). Consider:
- How do current students describe the atmosphere?
- Is the department collaborative or competitive?
- What is the completion rate, and how long do students typically take?
- What do graduates do after the PhD?

### Rankings and "Prestige"

Rankings matter less than fit, funding, and advisor quality. A student who thrives at a program ranked #30 — with an excellent advisor, a supportive environment, and research that excites them — will have better outcomes than a miserable student at a program ranked #5.

## The Application Timeline

**Summer before senior year:**
- Research programs and faculty
- Begin drafting your personal statement
- Identify letter writers and inform them

**September–October:**
- Finalize your program list (8–12 programs is typical)
- Refine your personal statement
- Provide letter writers with your CV, statement, and deadlines

**November–December:**
- Submit applications (most deadlines: December 1–January 15)
- Ensure all materials are received

**February–April:**
- Receive decisions
- Visit programs (if possible)
- Accept an offer by April 15 (the standard deadline)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Applying only to "top 10" programs.** Apply to a realistic range: 3–4 ambitious, 4–5 solid matches, 2–3 safety programs.

2. **Neglecting office hours.** Your professors can't write strong letters if they don't know you.

3. **Avoiding hard courses.** Admissions committees notice if you avoided real analysis or algebra. Take the hard courses and do well.

4. **Generic personal statements.** Tailor each statement to the program. Mentioning specific faculty and their work shows genuine interest.

5. **Waiting too long.** Start preparing in your second year. Take the right courses, build relationships, seek research opportunities.

## If You're Not Sure About Graduate School

That's normal. Consider:
- **Talk to graduate students** — ask them honestly about their experience
- **Take a graduate course** — see if you enjoy the pace and depth
- **Try research** — the difference between coursework and research is enormous; you need to experience both
- **It's okay to take a gap year** — work, teach, or do a master's program to gain clarity

## Final Words

Preparing for graduate school is a multi-year project. The students who are most successful are those who plan deliberately, build relationships with faculty, push themselves into challenging coursework, and maintain genuine curiosity about mathematics. 

The PhD is a long journey — typically 5–6 years. Choose a program where you will be supported, challenged, and happy. The mathematics will follow.
