## Introduction

The **Möbius strip** is formed by taking a rectangular strip of paper, giving it a **half-twist**, and gluing the ends together. The result is a surface with only **one side** and **one boundary** component — a foundational example in topology.

## Formal Definition

The Möbius strip is the quotient space:

$$
M = [0,1] \times [0,1] / \sim \quad \text{where } (0, y) \sim (1, 1-y)
$$

It is a **non-orientable** surface — it cannot be consistently assigned a "clockwise" direction at every point.

## Properties

| Property | Möbius Strip |
|---|---|
| Sides | 1 |
| Boundary components | 1 |
| Euler characteristic | $0$ |
| Orientable | No |

**The boundary** of the Möbius strip is a single closed curve — topologically a circle. Cut the strip along its center line and you get **not two Möbius strips**, but a single strip with two half-twists (an annulus).

## The Klein Bottle

Glue two Möbius strips along their boundaries and you get the **Klein bottle** — a closed non-orientable surface that cannot be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ without self-intersection.

The Euler characteristic: $\chi(\text{Klein bottle}) = 0$.

## Key Takeaways

1. The Möbius strip is the simplest non-orientable surface.
2. Non-orientability means there's no consistent notion of "clockwise."
3. The Möbius strip is fundamental to the classification of surfaces.
